those 01 the Gauls is credible 3 bnt that tha acme was the same is
unlikely. In the present case, then, Tacitus describes 0 German
custom by a Gallio name. That his error goes thus far I believe.
I do not, however, believe that it goes further3 in other words, I do
not think that the practice which he describes 10 so Gallicas not to
be Germanic also 3 or that he has confused the custom as well 00
misapplied the term. ⁴ s

At the mma time there is another view which may be taken. It
is just possible that Gach barda might hare formed part ’01 the
retinue of certain German chiess3 in which case they may have been
called by their employers by the name they bore 01 home. Howerer,
the national character of their functione, consisting 00 11 did 01 the
recitad 01001100 poenis, is against this.

Lastly-il' 0 reasonable interpretation 01 tho 00011-01-,000 be
obtained from any Gothic tongue, all objections against the present
statement falls to the grourm.

At present, however, it is best explained by assuming the falli·
bility 01 the author in which it occurs.

Lucan’s notice of the bardic poetr'y and doctrine is 00 follows :-

Vos quoque qni fortes animas, belloque peremptas
Laudibus in longum vates dimittitis aevum,
Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi.
llt 000 barbaricos ritus, moremque sinistrum
Sacrorum Druidae positis repetistis ab 011010. ’
Solis ndsse deos, et coeli numina robis,
Aut solis nescire datum est3 nemora alta remotis
Incolitis lucis: robis auctoribus, umbrae
N 011 tacitas Erebi sedes, Ditisque profundi
Pallida regna petunt 3 regit idem spiritus artus
Orbe alio 3 longa, canitis si cognita, vita
Mors media est. Gerte populi quos despicit Arctos,
Pelices errore suo, quos ille timorum
Maximus, haud urget leti metus 3 inde ruendi
In ferrum mens prona riris, animmque capaces
Mortis, 01 ignarum reditura parcere vitoe.
