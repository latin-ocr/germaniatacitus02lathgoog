The German term Dcutrcb isan adjectioe; the earlier form of the
word‘ being diutiac. Here the -iec is the same as the ab in words
like aelf-abb. Dior, on the other hand, means paophi, or amica.
Hence, diutine is ιο dior, as popularia is ιο populere. This adjective
was first applied ιο the longaespa- and served to distinguish the
populor, calioaol, antioc, or culpor tongue cf the populations to
which it belonged from the Latin. Ιι first appears iu documents of
the ninth century, “Ut quilibet episcopus homilias aperte trans-
ferre studeat iu rusticam Romanam linguam aut thembcam, quo
tandem cuncti possint intelligere quae dicautur.”—Synodus Tu·
renensis, am. 813.

As ιο the different forms in which either the root or the adjective
appears, the most important of them are as follows :-

1. In Menan-Gothic, piudtakd = idcirce-Galaticus ii. 143 a
form which implies the substantive piudo=idroa

2. In Old High German, diot=pcpuluc, gives the adjective diut-
iac=popul=aria

3. ln tunglo-Saron we have perid and predica

Sometimes this adjective means ΙιοοιΙιοος in which case it applies
ιο religion and is opposed ιο Christian.

Oftener it means intelligibla or concentor, and applies to lan-
guago3 in which case it is opposed ιο Latia.

The particular Gothic dialect ιο which it was first applied, was
the German of the Middle Rhine. Here the forms are various :—
tlaeodiocc, thiudisca, theudisca, teudisca, tcuthca. When we reach
parts less in contact with the Latin language of Rome, its use is
rarer. Even the Germana of the Rhine frequently uae the equi·
valent term Alcosoccic, and Froncic; whilst the Saxone aud
Scandinavians never seem ιο have recognized the word at all.

Hence it is only the Germaus of Germano that are Placet-acci, cr
Dera-scta.

We of England, on the other hand, apply it ouly to the Dutch of
Holland.

Hitherto the term is, ιο a certain degree, one of disparagement 3
meaning ooo-Rom, cr wilgar. Ιι soon, however, changes its
character 3 and iu an Old High German glosa-uccodiuti (arciaca)
