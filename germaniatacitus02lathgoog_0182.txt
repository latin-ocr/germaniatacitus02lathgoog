novus on snomos vi. 39

² Fromeos.]-This is a true German gloss. lt means a mtttay
rather than a mettim instrument3 its present power being pfrs'em:
punct, awt, bodks'a. 'Phe surreie called pfrinneulsraut3 the ιιοοιι,
pfectum-holos, and the N ardus arneto, Pfriemecgras.

Isidorus Hispalensis wrongly derives it from ferramentum ,·
“Frameo gladius estex utraque parte acutus, quam vulgo spathom
vocant. Frumso autem dicta quia ferreo aetnam siout ferramen-
tum sic franssa dicitur, ac proinde omnis gladius framec’'-Origg.
xviii. 6, 3.

lt is diffionlt ιο imagine any objections to the connexion between
framea and pfrieme, except such as aries out of the possibility of the
modern word having been derived from the plora in Tacitus-a not
unreusonable doctrine. This, however, is set aside by the extent to
which the word is shown by its compound, ιο be truly German. It
is also set aeide by the extent ιο which it appears throughout the
Gothic langnages -Dutch pstea, Anglodsxon preca, Ieelandio
tm·

Objections, however, boue been raised The p is not exsotly the
sound which, in the eyes of the striot believere in the uniformity of
letter-changes, grows out off. Neitheris the diphthong exaotly what
would be developed out of a. N either is the sense exactly the same
-“ 'Phe diphthong varies, and the sense does so still more-der diph-
thong aber abweicht, und der begrif noch mehr.”-D. S. i. olo.

Thero ie no objection to this minute criticism3 indeed, in and of
itself, it is good The change from fs* to pfv· is not of the most
usual sort 3 perhaps it is unique.

Again—the a in framea is short, as shown by a line of J avenel-

Per Solis radios, Tarpeiaque fulmina jurat,
ιιι Martis frdrwom, et Girrhoei spicula vatia-Sat. xiii. 78.

And a short vowel is not the best origin to a long diphthong.

Then, as a sword usta, whereas a framea stata the “sense is dif-
ferent.''

All this is good, is tobosa aem. Itis good against an etymologist
who asserta that the connexion between pst-teme and framea is so
undoubted and undeniable that no eane philologist can demur to it.

It is also good against any other etymology equally exceptionable
or unexoeptionable

But it is not good against such an etymology as the following,
followed up by the forthcoming inferences.
