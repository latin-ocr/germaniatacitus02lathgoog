For the particular colony of the Warasci‚ see note in u.
Naristi.

Iu the same neighbourhood (ia, on the Doubs) were
several pupi of·-

u. The Communi, Amavi, taking as a later form, the name
pagus Aramaua, Emuur, aud Amuusensr‘r—

t. The Attuarii, Attuarii, Hutaarii, or Hutourii.

There can he little doubt but that these were Chamavi
aud Chattuarii remoded from their original localities.

The detail oi such colonias is a point of minute ethnology.
They are mentioued bere, however, for the sake of showing
that the presence of certain populations in certain localities,
is to be taken with cantion. They may exist without the
parts about them being similarly occupied. lu which case
the populationis eporedia.

Now, iu order to constitute a true ethuologioel mea, a
populatiou must not be isolated, uuoounected‚ or φοναώἱσ, but
continuares.

The Germauy of Tacitus extends from the Rhiue to the
parts about the aether-country of Gourlaud ou the north, aud
as far as Gallicis on the south: to each of which countries
we bave special allusione.

For the intermediate portion of Europe, the frontier is
carried at least as far as the most eastern of these points; and
possibly further—possibly further, because the eeutral uation
of the Lypr‘r', whose country coincides with the modern king-
dom of Poland, is described as a large one.

With these limits it includes Mechlcnbuur, Braudeuburg,
Pomerauia, East and West Prussia, Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia,
and Poland.

By the Gormuny of Tacitus, l mean Tacitus according to
the usual interpretation ; without either affirming or denying
that his text requires this extent of country to rerisy it.
