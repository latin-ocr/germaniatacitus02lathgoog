Sneh is the current reading in Strabo, who makes nu men·
tion of the Langobardi. ’

See note in v. Langobardi.

The word is componnd aud why should there not have
been three separate substantive natione with names eom·
pounded of—

l. The root hrot ÷a prelis.

2. The root laq ÷ an affin—niz. :-

1. Langobardi, or the men with either long doado or long
baldetr-

2. Lauro-bardi, or the men with lwnda (or alban) en·
dowed with some quality expressed hy lco-

3. Largo-surgit, or the men whose rar-ka (whatever they
were) were huy?

All such forms exist; certainly iu good authors, possibly
ingoni] MSS.

Then there are,-

4. The Heopebards of the Traveller’s Song, and,-

5. The Barda of the Slavonic Bardeu-wie.

Ι have no deoided opinion here. It is my impression‚
however (and limagine that the common sense view of
the question coincides with it), thet the langobardi, Lnooo-
bardi, and Loaqosarqi are oue and the same population.

The truth is, that geographioal texts require every peculiar
kind of oriticIsm.

a. We cannot prefer one reading to another, beeuuse it will
give uncertain results ; since that (in many casm) is arguing
in a circle, ia, inserting the reading from the result, aud the
result from the reading. “

b. We cannot, as in other cases, argue from the contextr
since the question isone of tettan rather than of wordr3
aud a proper name, in many enses, can as little be col-
lected from the words w'hioh accompeny itas the unmean-
ing oombiuations which form a chorus can from the words
