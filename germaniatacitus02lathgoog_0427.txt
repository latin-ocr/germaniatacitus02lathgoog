The objectus, notified in not. ad v. Sarntotia (p. 16), against
the power of the word Jasyk, finds its place here. In Majiar
Jasa9=howmau Now 11 we carry the existence 01 Majiars
in Europe as far beyond the date of the Siculi (supposing
them to be what 10 here suggested) as the Siculi are earlier
than the undoubted Majiars, the name of the Joayyee may
be not Slavonic hut Majiar.

This would, certainly, throw a doubt over many important
deductione. But, 00 110 Mojiars may have taken the name
from the Jozyges, and having lirst called thechmochua
others so also, Ι do not lay much streas on the fact. Resides
which the word Jazyk would not cesse to be Slavonic simply
because it was Majiar aleo.

If we look bach 00 110 evidence of these tribes being

Germanic, we shall find what we found with 11011ορ1100-
the evidence 01 their locality and the testimony of certain
authors against them, that of their alliances and the names
of their leaders 10 favour of them.

The Rugii have the 1001 claim. They have a aomo in
common with the Rugii 01 Το01100; 101 1110, even if 110110 10
00 exceptione, would only imply a migration—uot, 00000-
sarily, a Germanic one. On the other hand, they are identi-
lied with the Tarcilioyi‚ whose claim to be considered Ger-
mansis the worst.

The Heruli have their relations 10 111οΑ01000ος 101 this
only implies thet the Auiones moved southwards.

Upon the whole, I think that none were German—but am
unable to distribute them among the ank, Slavonic and
(even) Ugriau stochs.

The populations which now follow, have their relations with
English rather than 1100000 history.
