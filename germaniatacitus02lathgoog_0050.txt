cerned, is scientifically correct. What Tacitus tocco of thc
Germana of the south was, that they extended as far down
the Danube as the fronticr oi Pannonia (say, the parts about
Pesth); and be bad no reason to imagine that their southern
extension went one hair'sbreadth further in an easterly
direction than did their northern one 3 orrico amad. Hence,
the extension ol their area, as far along the Baltic as it w‘as
known to reach along the Danube, was legitimate: subject,
of course, to correction from further investigation3 and
equally legitimate was the assumption that the Ligii and
other populations of the intervening parts were German—since
the reasouing ran thus-

a. The southern Germana run thus far eastwards.

b. The cortina do the same.

e. So do the parts interjacent. Subject, isay, to correction
from absolute investigation tbis a priori view was strictly
scientific3 and who shall say that Tacitus put it forth nncon-

Again-had the Beltic been even less German than it

actually was, it was only through Germane that it was known
to the Greeks and Romans: what, then, was more natural
than that the extent of tbe German sea-board upon it should
be over-valnedt Like the present Danes with their occupancy
of tbe Sound‚ their prominence exceeded their occupaucy.
These and similar consideratione show that such inaccu-

raciea as we find in Tacitus are, so far from subtracting from
his valna as an authority, or from the respect due to his tes-
timony, that they enbance his credit. Such as occur could
hardly heve been avoided ; and the only wonder is that there
arc so few of them.

If, however, we deny this reasonable amount of inaccuracy,
the thoroughly hypothetical character of the migratione in
question cannot bc too strongly stated, or too prominently
exhibited. They are referable to one head, and to one head
only, oia, tbe facts which they will explain. In and of
themselves they are wholly uusupported-unsupported with-
out, however, lying beyond the pale of observation. The
countries to which they appertain were known (at least)

well enough for Tacitus aud others to write abacti2 The
