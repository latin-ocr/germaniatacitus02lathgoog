supposing them to have been thus exceptional to their country·
men, they may be considered as the only Germane of whose
existence in the time of Tacitus we are sure.

It was as little for the want of actual wars and migratione
as for the paucity of hostile neighbours, that these exceptione}
Germane of the Danube are found, in the fourth, fifth, sixtlr,
seventh, and eighth centurias, in the locality assigned to them
by Tacitus in the second.

There was much of each. This we Iooow to have been
the case. Of similar wars and similar migrations, on the
Oder and Vistula, we know nothing; we only assume thern
for the sake of accounting for a supposed change of popula-
tion.

Now it is certainly unscientilic to attribute so much, in
the way ol displacement, to the wars and migratione of which
we know nothing, when those which we do know are known
to have done but little. On the real theatre of action, the
Middle Danube, what is it that we find in the time oi
Tacitus? Romans, Germana, Slavonians, all on the Rhatian
and Pannonian frontier, the Romans having tho lion's share
of country. What in the time of Theoderici Germane,
Romans, and Slavonians, the Germane possessing much of
what the Romans had lost. This is what we see on the
points illuminated by the clear light of history; and the
changes implied are but mosaco. In the parts beyond,
however, everything increases its dimensione. The wass are
more exterminatiug, and the migratione longer, the displace-
ments greater than anything known elsewhere. ls this the
view which we get from that cautious induetion which measures
the unknown by the known, or is it a mere sketeh of the
imagination, where all things show larger in the twilight, and
where anything may be assumed, because, though there is
nothing to support an hypothesis, there is nothing to con-

inroad which so obliterated the eastern Germane of the
Germania of Tacitus, was not exclusively Slavonio; it was
Lithuanic as well. Neither was the whole area which, in
