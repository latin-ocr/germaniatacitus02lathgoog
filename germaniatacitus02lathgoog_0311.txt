the coast changes suddenly from east ιο north ; sc much sc as to
make the parts in question, lor some time, the most eastern extre-
mity of the Baltie. From Memel to Windau, the navigation ia due
north, and it ia only by keeping along the coast that the Guli ol
Riga is found to form a bend towards the east. 'Phe Guls of Fin-
land does so still more. But this isonlylorawhile. Finland itsels
is nearly in the same longitude with Gouriand

Unless, then, we take in the Gulfa ol Riga and Finhnd, the
country os the Estii is really the east-end of the Baltic

Furthermore-except ior the purposes os a special trade, the
gulsa in question were not likely ιο be visited ; since from the
position of the islanda Oesel and Dago, at the entrance oi the Gnlf
of Riga, aud the narrowness of the entrance of the Gulf os Pin·
leud, it was not necessary for even the most cautious coasters to
follow the liue oi the land, on a voyage from Memel in Gouriand to
Abo in Fiuland.

It is likely, then, that those Germana, who applied theterm AErtia'
to the Gourlanders, made no account oi the Gulfs of Riga and Fin-
land; in which cases the Curbehe Nebrunp was rightly designated
ιι cartem, ιον ’.ἕξόχην .

We, however, who do make account of those great indentations,

placed our Euat· men iu Estbcuia.
The quotation alluded ιο is one from Stephanus Byzantinus-
'llcrtuvcc‚ ἔθνος παρὰ τῳ dure erp ὠκεανῷ οὓς Κοσσίνους Ἀριιμίδιιρός

φησι, Πυθέας 'himenleve
Pytheas is the voyager, whose account of the Baltio about 320

uc is treated with some contempt by Strabo—i. p. 63.
Ilowever, it by no means follows that ιιοιιιιο the name was
Gothic it applied to a Gothic population ; indeed, as far aa we can

get evidence for a negative fact, it is against the word AEwii being

² nlaiikb niimpelenty os mention between the time os Tacitus and the

eleventh century of these same AEatii,· but it is only by writers who
were themselves either Germane cr adopters of the German geography
that the name is Hert, aaa, or some similar form.

General, however, as the name is in the Germanic authorities, is
it rare in those os Russia, Pruseia, Polandt Probably, it is not to
be found at all. Instead, thereos, we have the term Pruna (Preciae)
or the more remarkable form Guddoa
