very similar ιο ἱι, such as saussay, Xanthum, &c

Thongh this is an extreme case, it illustratas the points ol
question-it being assumed, of course, that the similarity is
wholly occidental. If Englishmen had been there previously,
the case would be different. The similarity would then hc
other than accidentul; und a connexion of some sort or other
between the district in which the settlement took place, and the
district from which the settlers originated would account for it.

No oue imagines Boston in Massachusets ιο be a native
Indiau name. Yet why should it nothe sol Not because
the combination was either impossible or improbable for un
indiam but because it is the name ola town in England-
from whence some of the settlers came, or upon which they

we should have bean nearly as sure of, if the details of the
foundation of Boslon of Massachusets were unknown, as we
are now.

The presence of Englishmen in the two Bostons would
have been conclusive3 tha chauces against a people con-

Boston ready-made (as it were) in respect to name, being
incalculably great. ²

But what if the Boston in Massachusets were the older
name of the twol Difficulties would nrise. We could not
then derive it from the Boston in Lincolnshire.

It is not necessary to carry this hypothetical illustratiou
further: mutatis mamus, the argument which it involves
applies to the Gotls aad the aete.

α. The names are alike: indeed by the later writers Geta
is used as equivaleut ιο Gordiu and in Pliny we find Gauda

d. The supposed country of the Gotho is Germeuy: the
undoubted country of the Gelu is the Lower Danube.

c. Of the two names that of the Gelu is the older.

lu this case we really hawgtbpgdifficulty so lately indicated.

Emigrants, with the name Gothi, leave Germuuy3 aud, of
all the countries iu the world, settle in one belonging ιο a
people with a name so like their own as that of the Getes scci-
