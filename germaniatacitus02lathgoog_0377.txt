Neither must itha too large; inasruuch as room must be
leit for the equally important divisione of the Burgundians,
during the later, and for the Goths of the Danube, the Thu-
ringiaus, aud the Chatti, in the earlier, period of their history.'

Modern Suebis comes under this category; so that modern
dualia may be considered as the neckar of the Alamanno-
Snevic confederation.

That active emperor, Probus, coerced the Alemanni3 he
coerced them and something more. He recovered the whole
country of Suabia, and is said to have ire-established the limes.

But from the time of Probus downwards, the Alamanno-
Suevic eucroaehments steadilyprogressed. Before aa. 300,
they had become the aucestors of the present Germane of
Switzerland3 and, by an, 400, those of the Alsatiaus and
Bavariaus.

Such was their time aud scene. Strongly contrasted with
the Goths, they advauced their frontier gradually and con·
tinuonaly3 and the effect of this is, that oue half of what at
present constitutos the HighGermau division, is of Alemanno·
Suevic origin.

In individual heroes thia division is poor; none of its
kings or generals having the prominence of an Alaric, a
Theodoric‚ a Gundohald or a Oloris.

Putting together what has been said about the names
Alemanni aud Sacri, it is just possible that, of the two chief
members of this allianee, those whose name was Gennan
were (laule (the Alcimum), end those whose name was Gallie
(Saeve) were Germana. This, however, is a forcihle way of*
patting an apparent objection, rather thau au objection itsell.

If the Alemanni, originally, were not German, their
nationality and characteristies must have merged into that
of the Suevi early.

Believing the Vandal to have been Slavonic, the Alemanni
(supposing cl to mean alii) would he in the same relation to
tha Suavi as the former wareto the Goths.

It is not superfluous to remark‚that the Alemanni and Alani
ara undoubtedly confused by more than one ancient writer,—
a pregnaut source oi difficulty, which it is not necessary at
present to eularge on.
