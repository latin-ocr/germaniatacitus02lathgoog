tia call him so, and we of England nse the name thus applied.
But thetis all.

ln his own eyes he isa Majr'crr Moyerius ns the few old
Latin writers who adhere to the native appellatiou have it-
Mogerius‚ or sometimes Dente-Mogerius.

Yet, with all this, he is not e Hungariau exactly, as the
Spaniard ol the New World is e Mexicau3 and the reason why
tho Slavoniaus call him Huugarian is aot because he settled
iu a country to which the name of Huugary had been pre·
viously given by the Huus ol Attila. The proofs of this
name being iu use between the fifth and ninth centuries, are
few aad far between3 nor yet are they absolutely conclusive.

The real reason why the Mejiar bears iu countries around
him the saure name with the subjecte of the Scourge of God
lies deepcr. Just as the Germanic natione call not only the
GambroBritous by the name Welslr, but the Italicus also,
tho Russians of Eastern Europe called their most western
Asiatic neighbours by the generalname of Urrpri—whethsr
'l'urk or Fiuu: so that whether the one or whether the
other wrested from Europe a part of the soil, the territory
thus appropriated would equally be called Hungary.

This we leam from Nestor, who separates the Ugriau Ma·
jiars from the Turk Charete, by calling the oue Black the
other When* Hune.

From the name Heu not being native, the investigation
of the ethnological affinities of that natiou becomes difficult;
and this difficulty is increased by its being applied to two
different classes of western Asiatica It unfortunately
happens, too, that whilst the rulers of the Avars, the Οἱιειιατε,
the Petchinegi aud other tribes are frequently mentioned by
the truly Turlr term Khurr (Xdyavoe), that title is never
given to Attila-who is either ren or βασιλεύς. On the other
hand, however, Paulus Diaeouus writes- ‘⁶ Huni qui et Aram
dicamur ;'' aud Priscus speals of the ditarer-Heus (Ἀκάτιροις
Οὔννοις), the Tartar affinities ol the (lhazars being beyond

gipubt, an)d the king of the Avers being often called Khan
aporos .
