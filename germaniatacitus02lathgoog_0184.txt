uo hare giren, however, the nanre ιο a wcapon, mentioned by
'l'scitus end Juvenal, they must hare existed under that name
in the first-existed, as it were, in a latent state, and unknown as
Franks ιο the legions and commandens who conquered them. I
scarcely think that this strengthens the case.

Still the derivation may be both walid and waluable. It may
² teach us to look for the Fronte more closely, and, consequently, ιο
find them earlier than is supposed. ,

lt hes donc this in the case of its chief supporter. Ptolemy
- mentions a people called, Ἀνορτοφρακτοι, in Pannonio-and these
are considered tc be Φρακτοι, or Φραγκοι.

But Pannonia is a long way from the Frank country. Not
too far for sn etymologist. They carne from the llast, as, in the
eyes ol the etymologist‚ ull populations do.

sigebertus Gemblacensis writes, “Francis pust Priamum, Priami
filius Marcomerus et Sunno filius Antenoris principantur snnis
xxxvi, quorum ducatu Franci Sicambria egressi consedere secus
Rhenum in oppidis Germanice.n

Here the force of etymology stops, lor it hes not hitherto gone so
sar as ιο connect frames with King Petam.

But, though cll this may bs wrong, there was really a relationship
between the Franks and the Pannoniam Yes 3 Augustus plnnted
οὗίὀαοιὸνίαπιι legion in Hungary. No such Sicambrisn colony,
however, will make 'Asaproppoerot Franks, or deduce the subjecte
ol Oloris from the Danube, any more than our Indian possessione
will make London a colony ol Onlcutta.

Now the previous doctrine is not the fruit os the old empirical ’

etymology, which took no account of consonante, and locked upon
vowels es nothing, but the result of those so-oslled iren-bound
· laws of lettcrchange, which leod their supporters to demur to
deducing pst-icore from smmed

'l'here are certain things less legitimately assumed than sn uu-
manngeable letter-change ; and a migration which connects the
Franks ιο Ἀναρτοφρακτοί is one ol them.

'lhe doctrine exhibited above is James crimme-D. Si 512

But the change from fre, ιο pfr-‚ is by no means a serious dif-
ficulty3 since there is no proof os its ever haring taken place.
