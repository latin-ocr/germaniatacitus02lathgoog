The three texts of Jornandes, Paulus Diaconus, und the
Traveller's Song, give us the rough materiale for the criticisnr
of the traditione of the Gothic nation. Their historical and
ethnological velue is another question.

To begin with Jornandes. He quotes·more than one

contemporary events, any statement of any such writer is
valneble.

their ecclesiastioal and classical learning are heterogeneously
intermixed with the proper Gothic narratives.

b. In the case of Jornendes, numerous real or supposed
facts, relating to the Geta, are confused with those relating to
the Gothi.

These objections are of special applicatiou.. To which
must be added those which apply to tradition in general;

tradition-true and genuine tradition being the transmission
of the account of an actual event from one generation to
another, by nnwritten communication.

For this. it is absolutely neccmry that the event trans
