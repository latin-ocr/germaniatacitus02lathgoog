The languagee hore spoken are, at the present moment referable
to three familias-l. German in Lover Aueria, and on the side
oi Lover Austris 2. Slavonic on the side of Styria, Oroatia, and
Slavonia. 3. Majiar, or Proper Hungarian in the central parts.

The present population of Pannonia cannot but be extremely
mixed, since, over and above the present occupante, there have been
successive invasione os Romane, Goths, Hune, Arare, Gemanians, and
Gepidae. All this complicatos the inquiry ae to the ethnological

The Germane of Lover Austris are the Germane oi Upper dustria
