written barbamque eastweard-'Phe whole evidence οι anti-
quity is to the abundant locks of the Germane, aud to their yellov
hue From the cnstoms ci some ol the Frisian or Norae popu-
lation, especially that οι the supposed Norse settlements of Mol·
qnerum and Hindelopen in Friesland, as they appear in the
twelfth and thirteeuth centurias, it is probably that this golden cr
ssaxen hue vas artificially heightened, aa, by alkaline svashes of
soda or potash ley. The likelihood cf this must be borne in
mind vhen we consider the extent ιο which the present prepon-
deranoe of dark or brcvrn hair amongst many Germanic popula-
tions ie resemble ιο a real change of colonr; inasmnch es it
possibly may be accounted for by the disum of the habit of blanch-
ing it

In' all ethnclogical questions connected with the oolour end
texture of the hair, the customs of the country, in respect to the
dressing of it, should be ceresully attended ιο. Thus amongst the
islanders οἱ more than one part ol the Sonth Sea and Indian
Ocean, where the hair is naturally jet-black, there is the practice
of vashing the head in ash, or lime-water—vhich gives it a red
tinge. Hair, thus discclcnred, has been described by excellent·
writers es being red.

The populaticn vherein really, and naturally, red hair prepon-
derates,is not German, bnt Ugm'an3 the Votiak, and other Finns
of the Volga, being pre-eminently πΰῤῥοις and, Ι think it likely
that when we hear cf Germane being thus distinguished (aa, as
red rather than gelboae-haired), these alkaline vashes may have
had something to do with the epithet. Such are common. Silius
Italicus calls the Batavian ‘⁴ russis Batavus.’'-iii. 608. More ex-
press still is the following extract from Galen :-Oiiroc γοῦν τινὲς ’

ὀνομάζουσι τοῦς Γερμανοῦς iusticie, καὶ rol γε οὒκ ὄντας Sardois, ἐὰν
α’κριξῶς τὶς tollor καλεῖν, dhhd πυῤῥοῦς.

ιΤιοοι loug hair was generally an honourable ornament, we infer
from its being amongst the Franks a sign ol being afreemen3
whereas, to have the hair clipped, vas a degrading punishment. At

the same time, as this very passage implies, the German modes of
wearing it were varicus. Herodian mentions the κουρά τῶν Pep-
μανῶν (iv. 7); and Seneca the rufus crinis et coemere iu nodum opetd
emnam-De lra, c. 26.
