Ninauna has expressed an opinion, that the Gomoario was
written during the youth of Tacitus.

Whatever other reasons there may be for holding this view,
there is the following,—

A writer iu a monograph is generally fuller of details than
ha is in a general work. Now iu the Annals and History,
there are several German tribes mentioned, of which no notice
is taken in the emmam, and this omission is explained by
the notion‚ that Tacitus's knowledge increased between the
composition of the different works. Strange as it is, that
he should not have known the Sicambri, Ampsiuarii, luc,
when the Germania was written, it is stranger still, that he
should have known and not enumerated them.

Hence, the Annals and History are, to a certain extent,
the complement to the Germania, and similarly to compare
small things with great, the present Epileyomeaa form the
complement to the Notes.

of the populations mentioned in the Annals and History,
but not mentioned in the Germania, the following is the list.

1. The Sicambri-First mentioued by (iasar on the Lowar
Rhine (see extracts p. lxxix.), the Sicambri take considerable
prominence aud importance iu the reign of Augustus. Being
conquered by Drusus, they appear more than once in the
poetry of both Ovid and Horace, as lormidable enemies now
humbled. Indead, few names wera more associated with the
ideas of murderous ferocity and savage bravery than that of
the chamle.
