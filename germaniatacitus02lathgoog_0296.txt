A shade of evidence in favour of the original Narisca' having been
Slawonic, isto be got srom the confusion between the form in -sc-
and that in st· ; the idem-iay being yreaud.

A Selnooaic affinity would best account lor this; since, suche
form might end in m'tsb (Nardsleha syllable which contains tow

loped. N ayl such an ending as ewen atat would be nothing
unusual in Slavonic. n'o German form exista which gives us an
equally probable origin of the two forms. In that language it would
be either -ak ιο the exclusion of the sound ol ι, or ist ιο the exclusion
of that os k,· neither of which would be sufficiently strange ιο ο
Roman or Gmek ear ιο be mistaken l'or the other, or, indeed, sor
anything elsa Very different, however, would be the case with the
complex Slavonic sibilante.

As τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ may apply ιο any portion ol Roman Gaul, this

Again-as a mere gness, I suggest the probability of their repre·
senting some of those intrusiwe members of the kingdom of Ariovistus
who appropriated a third of the land of the Sequani, as related by
Oaesar.

preliminaries to this note: indeed, to a certain extent they stand in
place of it.

The Marco-neonae? in question were those ol the 'Pshekh or Bohe-
mian March, and, I imagine, they extended from the valley of the
Naab ιο lower Austri23 their area following thelina of the moun-
