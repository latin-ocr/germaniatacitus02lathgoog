that the circumstance of certain Greek towns of Southern
ltaly, calling their slaves Pelasgi, indicates a previous Pelasgic
population. By a not illegitimate extensiou of this view,
the existence of the system of casus is supposed to betoken a
duality of raca-the conquered and the conquerors. But a ⁸
servile class of conquered aborigines, was as much wanting in
the Slavonian portione of the Germanic, when it was first
known otherwise than by hearsay‚ as the analogues of the
Welsh or Biscayaus. The signs of a primitive populatiou,
shown as they show themselves in Britain or Spain ς shown
as they showed themselves in Greece or ltaly; or shown as
they slrowed themselves in Hiudostsn‚ were equally nou-
existent.

Neither were there any traditione. No lays celebrated
either the Arthur which defended, or the lde which ravaged
the soil. The supposed conquerors knew of no indigeam
which they replaced. No indam complained of the
stranger who dispossessed them.

Lastly‚ Suasa as is England, the oldest geographical terme
are Kslte'cr some of the original names of the rivers and

· ·mountains remaining nuchauged. The converse is the case

in Transalbiugian Germany. The older the name the more
surely is it Slavonic.

So much for the extent of the assumed displacement. lt
must have been the greatest and the most absolute of any
recorded in history.

It must also have taken place with unparalleled rapidity.
By supposiugthet the assumed changes set in immediately
after the time of Tacitus, and that as soon as that writer had
recorded the fact that Polaud, Bohemia, and Gourland were
parts of Germania, the transformation of these previously
Teutonic areas into Slavonic oues, began, we have a con-
dition as favourable for a great amount of changes as can
fairly 'be demanded. Still it may be improved. The last
traces of the older population may be supposed to have died
ont only just before the time when the different areas became
known as exclusively Slavoni03 an assumption which allows
tlre advocate of the German theory to say that, had our in·
formation been a little earlier, we should have found what we
