’ 11018 than this-the record 128811 18 notabere suspicion. The
part 01 the stone which contains the letters aa, has been repaired,
and (the extract is from Niebuhr) whether 118 “was put in at ran·
dom, or whether it vasso on the original stone, I can neither assent
ner deny. I have often seen the stone, but although a friend 01
mine wished me particularly to ascertain the truth, I was never able
