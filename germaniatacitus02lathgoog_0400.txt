So thet whether we assum a movement of the Angla
Suevi from Suabia, or one of the Suabian Suevi from the ·
Angla country, or deduce both from some intermediate aree,
we must assume a change of dialect as well. Zenss does this;
and deriving, as he does, the Suabians from the ancestors of
the English, believes that the former took a HighGerman
dialect in place of their own. Otherwise we may presume‚
English would be spoken at the present moment in Baden
and Wnrtembnrg,—nay‚ possibly in Switzerland‚ Bavaria,
and hostria, since theee were Alemanno-Suevic conquesta.

Ill. The Saevi Tramladeui. -Between the Scala, the
Baelo, and Hertz isa Gau named Somou. This was occupied
in the sixth century hya population called by the Franlr
writers Saevi.

The following extracta make them recent colonias, -
“ Tempore illo quo Alboinns in Italiam ingressos est, (lhle
thacharius et Sigibertns Saevos aliasque gentes in loco illo
posuerunt.”-Gregory of Toum, v. 15. “chlotarius et Sigis-
bertns reges Francomm Suaooe aliasque gentes in locis, de
quibus iidem Saxones exierant posuerunt.”-Paul. Diaconii. 6.

If the §5 on the Angli and Werini be now referred to,
it will be seen that the parts on the Thur-ingiam Heseian,
Slavonic, and Saxon frontiers were parts whereon settlements
appear to have been made to a great extent3 and it must
be remembered that the evidence here is of the kind called
cumulatim, so that, although absolute and nnimpeachable
reasons for any particular population being considered to
have originatcd in a military colony, cannot be given, there
are several populations contiguons to each other, for each of
which a small amount of evidence can be collected; the eam
of the probabilities being a large one.

Saeooo, then, as the name of a Gon, or popae, we have

already seem as aleo localities for the Angli* and the Werioi.
Besidee these, there is, in the same partae Frieowoseld, or
field ostfe Fabiolae,
These Saevi of the Gora named aava, have been con·
veniently called the naevi Praesident, ia, the Saevi be·
yond the Bode,· since the following passage occurs in Witi-

* See Epilegomeno‚ in vv.
