NOTES.

1.

The remarks ou the extent to which a Slavouic form iu
-sltsb might be presumed when there was a confusion
between -ac- aud -st- (see note in v. Nonaci), was written
before I found in L. G. Daae's work ou the Lithuaniau Family
that the actual Slavonic form for the German combinatiou
Sa, is stret (s’c' iu Bohemian, raca in Polish‚ and telo in
Russian), and that the Polish original of Stiayletz is szczypiel.
Such being the case, it is not too much to suggest that the
very existence of a confusion between at· aud -ac·, is primii
facie evidence of the true and original form being -adtsh, aad
consequently of the word in which it occurs being Slavonic;
for it is only in Slavouic that such combinatione occur.

ln p. 91 there is a material oversight. Tha Boii are
placed between the Maiae, Rhiue, aud Hercynian Forest.
They ought to have been placed in the parts leym the area
thus circumscribed. isay this oversight is material ; since
the true position of the Boii was nearer Bohemia than the
text of nota in a. Boiodcmam makes it. Still, tbe correction
by uo means carries it aa far east as Bohemia; since the plain
meaning of ulteriora is not osy part east of the Maiae, but
the parts that immediately (there or thereabouts) succeed, or
come next to, tha Helvetian occupaucy. Now, these are
parts (and no inconsiderable parts either) of Bavaria. Bohe-
mia, undoubtedly, comas afterwards in the sama direction;
but so do Gallicis and many other places. Tha commou-
sense interpretation seems to be that where tho Helvetiaus
left off, tha Boii began. Still, the statement iu the text
referred to isan over-statement.
