Strabo, Velleius Paterculue, all speak os the Cherusci, aud ull say
nothing about the Saxorm Ptolemy, as is well known, is the hrst
writer who mentions them. On the other hand Claudian is the last
writer iu whom we find the word Chemsci.

—weuit accola silwae
Bructerus Hercynia, latisque paludibus erit
Cimber, et ingentes Albin liquere Cherusci.
Consul iw. Houor. tot.

As long as wa hawa tha Cherusci there are no Saxona hs soon
aswe meet with the Saxone the Cherusci dissppear. ,

If we wish to out the Gordian knot, we oan have reoourse to the
assumption ol migration and displaeement-in which the Old Saxum

cease to be the descendente of the Cherusci and their allice, and re· ι

present a new and intmsiwe population aa foreign to the old Che·
ruscan country of Germany as they were to that of the Britous.
lbere are certain texts that encourage this new, ey„ the present
notioe of the fallen state or' the Cherusci and Fosi is in favour of their
being easily displaced aud superseded by some more flourishing im·
migrante.

Valeat metues It only does halfthe business. It only extin-
guishes the Cherusci. The presence and preponderance of the
Saxone it leaves unexplained.

l'he full impert of this must be admitted.

a. 'l'he Saxone, which by assumption are supposed to replaoe the
Cherusci, cannot be got from the country of the coeat l'he Chatti
wera High Germane.

b. Nor yet from that of the Chauci· The majority of the Chaum
were Frisians.

c. Nor yet from that oi the Lower Rhine. 'l'he language here
was PlattDeutsoh Ι

More then this-they could uot hare oome from any small or in·
considerable country at all, from none oi the noolrs or corners
between the Great Frisium PlattDeutscb‚ High German, aud sle
wonic areas une differenoes between the Anglo-Saxou and Old
Saxon dulcere, show that the common language was spoken over a
large tract of ground, and that for a considerable length oi time.

ute assumption osa Saron immigrution into the Chemsosu terri-
tory, is not only gratuitous, but it angenders as many difficulties ae
it removes. ·
