importunae. But what is that of the geographical area now called
Bohemiat So unknown was that remarkable country ιο the Greeks
and Romans, that its obscurity war that of the central parts of Africa
in our own time. There was a reason for this. Its natural moun-
tain-rampart would preserve it from invasion.

'lhose same mountain-ramparts, however, which would thus tend
ιο keep the country inviolate, in the case of a war, could hardly
escape notice and description. Yet no such notioes and decemp
tione exist. ottho present Bohemia, we find no uaequicoccl ac·
count whatever in any Romen writer. Eqaiooool accounts we do
find: but these are got at by assuming the Marcomannic kingdom
of Maroboduus to have lain within Bohemia, and aa they apply to
this Marcomannis kingdom only, they cause to be Bohemian as soon
as the Marcomanni are placed elsewhere

It may simplily the question to anticipata.

I believe the Boio-teneam of Tacitus ιο have been, not Bohemia,
but Baocric.

Bovario and Bohemo'c are nearly the same words.

c. rho first element in each is the proper name Boii. In the
sixth and seventh centurias the fuller form oi Bavariais Rogo-oria,
Bai-corio, Bcjo-ars'a‚ Boia-catii, dvc.

ι. The second clement is equivalent io power, though not lasona,
to the second element in Bohemia, lt is the word wore=intotitaate
cr occupante in the Anglo-Saxon form, Oantwcre=people ofKem

Hence Botemic=the Boion οοοιφαοορῃ Bcocria=tte occupant
Boiano.

This lenda us to the fact that however much we may placo the
Boii in Bohemia, wo cannot do so eaduciorly. As far as the name
goes, there were Boii in Bavaria as well 3 Boii, too, who gave their
name to their land.'

But this is not enough. We require substantivo proof beyond ⁰

the inference arising from the similarity of name for this latter fact
At present the argument sunda thus :—

Boa‘ohem, in the timeof Tacitus, meant Bovario. Not so, may be
the answer. It is granted that only one locality may he intended
by the two names, but why may not Bovario originally have meent
Bohemial The answer to this must rest on its own grounds.

Itis no small argument in favour of the original single power

of the two names, ιο find that the alternative just indicated is a
real one. lause expende much learning upon it, giving reasons
