So thet to derive the German, Slevonic‚ Lithucnic‚
Greek end Lutin from India, is to derive the greater from the
less, the multiform from the simple, the admitted from the

doubtful. It is to deduce the stook from the offshoot, to
move the earth with u lever in the clouds*
All such connectione anthat between the Sauslarit end

ι 'l 1 must be allowed to remind the render thet from a desire to deul with
the questiones a question of logio only, and with the wish to understete,
rather then overstete, my cese, 1 argue entirely er mundani.

Thus-

n. Ι allow the Vedos to he four thousand years old—without beliering
unything ol the kind.

b. Ι allow the Hindu‚ Benguli‚ Urdu‚ quernti. Mehratta, and modern
Persian tongues, to be es truly Sunskritic in origin aa the English is Anglo-
Saron-without belicving it.

e. 1 cllow the Armenion to bc IndoEuropeon.

d. Alco the Ossetic. The only fecte respecting these last three points
which l urgue from, is the existence of doubts-not the relidity of them.

e. l lay no stress on the statement thet the third lenguage ol the cunci-
lorm inscription is other than ludo-Europeun.

f l cerry the traces ol e Temuliun tongere, cnnrior to the Binda, no
further south theu the parts ebout Bombey—

g. And the traces of monosyssubic tongues, similarly anterior to the
Suuahrit, no further south than the Lower Ganges.

h. l cllow the Sieposh to be us Sunshritic as the most extreme defendere
of its Sanslrritic origin make it, end l plece the Lnghmeni‚ and other
diolects, aa well es the Pustr'r of Affghanistsn, in the same oetegory.

ἰ. llcy no strecs on the Temuliun character of the Bruhdi, the uumerela
of which were admitted by hussen to be those of Seuthem India.

On the other hand-

As Ι take exceptione to the ludo-Europcnn cheroctcr of the Keltic
tongues, end although l sm, perhaps, the only philologist who does, l tete
no advantage ol the current opinion, by which the contrust between the
differences between the eo-culled Indo-Europecn tongues ol Europe and the
comparative homogeneousneas of those ol Asis would be heightened.

1 wish to reduce the question to its logioul form which is, that roten roe
hove roo henotes ostbe rame moleton ps speech separated stom each oete, one
os tollet ἐι tlte longerie cren ond tle more dieerrified ty onrntiet, end tlte other

To deduce the ludo-Europenses of Europe from the Indo-Europum ol Asin,
in ethnology, is lite deriring the reptiles of Grest Brituin from those ol
lrelund in erpetology.
