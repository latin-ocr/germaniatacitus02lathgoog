θ THE GERMANY OF TAGITUS.

German, and bnt few have considered Slavonic, we have iu
the different Han, Alan, Arar, and Bulgarian allianoes thc
following—

1. Alpibzari, αό. Ἀμόλ·ζουμοι, dac.

2. Alci-dauri, al. moini-aures, Ούλτί-ζονροι, hc.

3. hugi-sciri.

4. Ακότ-ζιροι.

If we add to these the word ending in perii, the number
is incensed-Sanpeus, Onopurir', &a

§xxxvn nnn nnnru.

It has been stated that the Alans were of the Turlr stook;
and as the Sciri have been placed in the same category with
thern, the Sciri being a people that has sometimes been oon·
sidered German, the investigation of their ethnology finds
place in the present work.

The two broad facts that bear upon this question are—

1. The area of the Alans is beyond that of either the.
Germane or the Sarmatisns. This was the parts due north
of Oiroassia, or the great irregular triangle formed hythe
Lower Bon, the Lower Volga and Caucasus.

2. The present occupante of this area are the Nogay
Tartars of the Turk stock—oconpants who cannot be shown
to be of recent introduction. ·

3. Luciau (Toxaris, 51) makes them Scythiam—Tama δὲ

ἔλεγεν ὁ Μακέντης, ὁμόσκευος καὶ ὁμόγλωττος τοῖς Ἀλανοῖς
ὤν· κοινὰ ιγὰρ ταῦτα Ἀλανοῖς καὶ Σκύθαις, πλὴν ότι ού πάνυ
κομῶσιν οἱ Ἀλανοὶ ὥσπερ οἱ Σκύθαι. Ἀλλὰ ὁ Μακέντης καὶ
ταῦτα εἴκαστο αὐτοῖς καὶ ἀποκεκάρκει τῆς κόμης, ὁπόσον
εἰκός ἦν ἔλαττον κομᾶν τὸν Ἀλανὸν τοῦ Σκύθου.

This reduces the stocks that may fairly claim them to three.

1. They may have been the most northern branch of the
Gircassians.

2. The most southern of the Ugrians.

3. Turks.

The Turk character of the present population favonrs the
third of these stocks.
