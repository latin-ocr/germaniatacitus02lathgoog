The third isa really substantia} reason, and would be valid
it' there were nothing to set against it.

Against it, however, stand,-

l. The aomo of the people themselves, which is pro·
bably a south-German form of the well-known root,
Vua, applied by the Germane in general to the Slavonians
in general.

Germanic area do we meet with any form of the root V-ad-l,
and no where do we find the mention of them as Geranooa'o,

Hence, I believe that the Venedi of the Germano of tbe

representatives are the more southam branoheo of tbe Pales,
along with some of the more nortbem Slovaks.
