torily confirmed,-heersay accounts, however, which have
just the same relation to the descriptione of the parte visited

by the Roman armies, as the doto sor the geography of
. (lentral Africa have to the eurweys of the colonica of Natal,
the Cape, or Augola.

This leads us to anew series of preliminary points of
criticiem.

A certain amount of migratiou eud displacement ie ueces-
sary. If Germane ware the original occupante of the parte
in question, the Slavonians must heve superseded them
in it.

The likelihood or uulikelihood of this must he tested in
several ways.

First, in respect to ite catast—The msumed migration must
have been uneurpassed, perhaps uuequally, by aoy other within
tha historica} period. When the Germane of (lharlemagne,
and hie successore, conquered (or reconquered) Transalbian
Germany, there was neither traco nor record oi any previous
Germanic occupaucy. Yet such previous occupaucy rarely
occurs without leaving signs of ite existence. Sometimes

there are fragments of the primitiva population eafe in the . ,

protecting fastnceees of some mountain, foreat, or feu, whose
savage independence testifiee their original claim on the soil.
In this way tha Welsh of Wales, aud the Basques of the
Pyrenees, are monuments of that aborigiual population which
held possession of Spain and Britain, long before the begin-
ning of history, and which partially holds possession of them
now. Yet there is no want of natural strougholds iu the
country in question. The Sexou Switnerland, the Bohemiau
range, the foreste of Lithuania might well have baeu to the
Germane of Tacitus, what Suowdon was to the Britous of
Agricola, or the Pyrenees to the old Iberians; in which case
the praeeat Germane of those conutriee would be the oldest
inhabitants of them-not the newest, as they arc.

Another way iu which a primitive, but displaced population
escapee annihilatiou ie, by taking upon itself the character of
a servile populatiou. Iu this way the Helots of Sparta,
represent the older inhabitants of Laconia, as well ae the
conquered Messeniaus. Upon this principle Niebuhr argues
