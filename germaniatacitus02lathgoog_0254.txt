XXXIII. Juxta Tencteros Bructeri¹ olim occur·
rebant: nunc Chamavos² et Angrivarios³ immigrasse

narratur, pulsis Bructeris ac penitus excisis, vici·
narum consensu nationum, seu superbiae odio, seu
praedae dulcedine, seu favore quodam erga nos deo-
rum: nam ne spectaculo quidem proelii invidere;
super nx. millia, non armis telisque Romanis, sed,
quod magnificentius est, oblectationi oculisque cecide-
runt. Maneat quaeso, duretque gentibus, si non amor
nostrl, at certe odium sul: quando, urgentibus imperii
fatis, nibil jam praestare fortuna majus potest, quim
hostiurn discordiam.

¹anctera'.]-Probable German forms of this word would be, ln
Anglo-Saxon Brcoclrtwarc, in Old Saxon summumst, in Frisian
Brjuclstwara.

My reason for helieving that the syllable eri, represents the second
clement in a compound word, and that that word was recreanda·
wana (cs in Contware=iolccldaatc os Rea) lies in the following
extract from Beda-“ Sunt antem Fresonea Rugini, Dani, Huni,
antiqui Saxones, Boructuarii, sunt etiarn alii perplures iisdem in
partibus populi, paganis adhuc ritibus servientes.”-Hist. Ecclesiast.
r. 10. rhe same writer repeats the name more than once.

Perhaps the same may have been the case with the form
rmom=renswara Be this as it may, notwithstanding the
contraction, the e in Bructeri is short. It is written with ε iu
Greek (Βροῦκτεροι). whilst in Latin we hare the following lines ol
Sidonius Apollinaris-

Toringus '
Bructerus, ulvosa rel quem Nicer alluit unda
Prorumpit Francus. -Carm rii. 324.

rue utter excision (pendes acco) of the Bructeri, is an over·
statement. Neither was their expulsion complets; on the contrary,
it was very partial. 'Ihis we leam from the subsequent notices of
the Bructeri, who are so far from being exterminated that they are
mentioned more than most other German tribes.
