1. The Slaronians of Oarinthia, Gerniola, Styrio, and .
south-western Hungory. Differing but slightly from-

2. The Orestinus-themselves the speakers of a lenguage
which extends, with but few variatione of dialect, from the
Adriatic to the Euxine—the language of the Montenegrino
mountaineers on the frontier of Albania, the Dalmatiam, the
Herzegorinians, the Bosniacs, the Serviane, the southern
Hungarians‚ the Slavonians of Slavonia at the junctiones the
Save and Danube, and the Bulgarians.⁸

The Slavonic languages, like the Germanic, must be studied
in respect to their history as well as their geographical
distribution-in respect to timo as well as ploce. In this
respect, the fact which has the most important application is
connected with the southern division of them. lt was in a

Serviam Oroatian, or Dalmatiam, dialect that Christianity was χ ·

first preached, and the first scriptural translations made.
Hence, the so·called old Slavonic hos the sanie importanee in
Russian and Servian philology as the Moeso-Gothic basin
German.

The northern frontier of the south-slavonic area is formed
by a line running through Styria, Sonthern Hungary, and the
northern part of Bnlgaria; the southern frontier of the
northern by Bohemie, Moravia, Gallicis, Volhynia, and Podo-
lia; the intermediate nocaSlavonic countries being Hungary,
Wallachia, and Moldavia.

The Hungarians, or Majiars, are of Finnic origin, and
constitute en intrusive population, the date of their intrusion
being the tenth centmy.

The Wallachians, Moldavians, and Bessarabians are par-
tially at least of Latin origin, and, so far as they are so,
they⁷ constitute, like the Maiiam, an intrueive population,
the date of their intrneion being the second century, ia, the
time of Trajan the conqueror of Dacia.

We have seen that, in respect to their geographical dis·
tribution,⁰the Russians, Poles, end Bohemians, belong to
one division, thc Serviane and Slavonians to another. Is
