a form of the Gothic speech nearer our own language than either
the Dutch of Holland, the Scandinavian dialects, or the High German.

In another new and peculiar point of viem the Frisians claim
notice Their history is, to a certain extent, a physioal history.
Many branchos of the stem to which they belong have been lopped
off hythe hand of man, hy war, by famine, by oppression hravely
withstood. But others have given way to a stronger and more
nnconquerable power-that of Nature. It is the Frisian area that
most oi the great inundatione of the North Sea have broken in
upon. What Vesuviushas been to Campania, AEtna to Sicily, Heola
ιο Ioeland, the Ocean has been ιο Frisia.

'l'he proper complanent to the ethnology of this brooch, would
be the physical history of the North Sea ; and this is what Ole-
mens, the bost investigator of the least known part of the family
-the North Frisians-has sketched.

The Frisians have ever been the people of a reticiaq froom,
' ic, whilst others have encroached on their oocupancies, they have
never, within the historioal period, been successful invaders and
permanent aggressors elsewhere. Not, at least, by land. By seo,
the case may have been different3 so different, that in our own
island much that passer for AngloSaxon in origin may be Frisian3
a matter to which a special notice has been dedicated*

On the west the Ocean; on the north the Danes and how Ger·
mans ; on the south the Low Germane have been the encroachers.

'l'he fact of the Frisians haring thus suffered stom encroach·
ment, rather than gained by aggression, has a practical hearing.

Frisian oocupanoy may be inferred from certain characteristico,
hereafter to he illustratcd: and these characteristics we find in
localitics far beyond the present Frisian area Now, had the
Frisians boen a family of conquerors, the inferenoe would be that
the introduction was recent, and that, upon some earlier occupancy,
Frisian elementa might have been· engraftod. But as the truth is
the reverse of this; astho Frisians have habitually retreatcd rather
than advanced, the conclusion is different3 and as Frisiann ames of
geographical looalities—sor of this sort are the characteristios in
question-may raasonahly ιο assumed to denote Frisios occupanoy
οοιονιον ιο that of the present dominant population.

Of all the ancient names of German populations, the term Frisii
has beon the most permanent hess altered in form than Chatti, as
