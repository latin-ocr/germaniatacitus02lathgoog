:ureDatcle is explained by barbaras. All that is not German, has
now become in the eyes of the Decet-sole, what all that was other than
Roman was before. The standard hae changed. Barbarism is
measured by its departure from what is Dat-selu in other words,
the term has become so little derogatory as to have become national

Nevertheless, originally Dccctscltc=mcl9orm

From the two facts of &moenio being no native name, and Deut-
oclcc being one of late origin, we arrive at an inierence of great prac-
tical importance in ethnological criticism, oie, that, although the
Romans and the (lauls knew the populations beyond the Rhine by
a common collective term, no such common collective term seems to
have been used by the Germane themselves. Tlcyltocleoec. Each
tribe had its own designation3 or, at most, each kingdom or con·
federation. Only when the question as to what was common to
the whole country, in opposition to what was Rornae or Gallia,
becomes great practical fact, did a general ethnological term ariae 3
and this was not omnen, but Dotclc.

This is a common phenomenon. In Hindostan we hear of the
wilder mountaineers of Orissa aud the Mahratta country under the
names os Kel and Khond 3 and thiais a collective term. But it is
only this in the mouth of a Hindu, or Englishman. Amonget
themselves the separate names of the different tribes is all that
incurrent.

From this it follows that, Germania being a eoeGermenic term,
ite claime to absolute ethnologicel accuracy are reduced. It is like
the term Gallia ,· which was so far from containing nothing but Gallie
Kelts (or, changing the expression, Keltic Gauls), that it included the
Ibcric populations of Aquitania, which were as unlike the true Gaul
aa a Basque of the Pyrenees is unlike a Welshman. Hence, when-
ever we are disposed to doubt whether so valuable a writer as
'laeitus could have committed the error of making any particular
nort-Germanic tribe German, we must remember that so well-in·
formed an observer as (laesas malres the Aquitani, Gallie.

It is also important to remember that, like tipo as opposed to
low, riclt to poor, dcc, the word Dcatscl was originallya corre·
latice term, ia, it denoted something which was populor, vulger,
national, ooleamcd, to something which was not. Hence, it could
harahad no existence until the relations between the learned and
lettered language of Rome, and the comparatively unlearned and

unlettered oolycr torque of the Franks and Alemanni had developed
