Tacitus—Tacitus coincides with Strabo, iu giving to the
(limbri a specific locality, and in stating special circumstances
of their history. Let full weight be given to the words of a
writer like Tacitus3 but let it also be rememhered that he
wrote from hearsay evidence, that he is anything rather than
au independent witness, that his statement is scarcely recou-
cilable with those of Ptolemy and Oaeser, aud that aboveall
the locality which both he and Strabo give the cimbri is
also the locality of the Sicambri, of which latter tribe no
mention is made by Tacitus* although their wars with the
Romans were matters of comparatively recent history. For
my own part, Ι think, that between a confusion of the
Cimbri with the Cimmerii on the one hand, and of the
Cimbri with the Sicambri on the other, we have the clue to
the misconceptions assumed at the commenoement of the
paper. There is no proof that in the eyes of the writers
under the Republic, the origin of the Cimbri was a matter of
either doubt or speculation. Catulus, iu the History of his
Consulship, commended. by (liceto (Brutus, xxxa), and
Sylla in his Commentaries,‘must have spoken of them in a
straightforward manner as Gaulo, otherwise Cicero and

Sallust would have spoken of them less decidedly. (See
' This ought to be “ by Tacitus iu his omnm-n. G. L. lael.
