It cannot he denied that the contrast between the evidence
of Tacitus, who wrote from what he heard in the second,
and the evidence of the authors of the time of (lharlemagne,
who wrote hom what they knew, in the ninth, is remark-
able. What are we to sayl

l. That the evidence ol Tacitus must be impugned.

2. That the evidence of Tacitus must be limited.

3. Or, that a vast system of migratione and displacements

a Slavonic population on the strength of the former fact,
irrespective of the conflicting testimony of Tacitus, 'is illegi-

same level, aad requires the same amount of testimony for
probabilities and improbabilities, for the barely possible and
for the morally certain.

Of all the populations east of the Elhe which Tacitus, in
the second century, called German, no single vestigo appears
in the tenth. How is tlrisl Was the original statement
