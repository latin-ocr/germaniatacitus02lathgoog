'l'hat caear was the chief first-hand authority for the
main details conceruing early Germany, is evident; at the
same time it is not iu Caesar that the classilication into
Ingaevones, Istaevones, hc, is to be found. Neither is itin
Oaesar that the parts which were not visited until after his
timeare described. The broad distinction between Gaul and
German ia his; the Gaul being taken ae the type.

The extent to which the names in Caesar differ from
those of Tacitus creates certain slight difficulties. His uo-
mention of the Occi is a most remarkable instance of this.
That Oaesar's names are chiefly Gallio, whilst Tacitus’s are
Germanic, is, iu the mind of the present writer, the chief
explanation here.

The prartcst difficulty lies in the second and third ex·
tracts, wherein certain Belgica populations are made Ger-
man. Ι can only reconcile this with the great prepondcrenoe
of evidence in favour of the Belga being Gacb, by consider-
ing the term Belgio in the book of Caesar to be political
rather than ethnological; in other words, to denote a cou-
sedorctioc rather thau a homogeneous nation. At the same
time we may admit both intermixture* and intrusion.

These preliminaries precede the following extracts3 the

criticism of which will liud its place in different parts of the
body of the book.

XXX. Bello Helvetiorum confecto, totius fere Gallia
legati, principes civitatum, ad Gaesarem gratulatum conve-
nerunt: “intelligere sese, tametsi, pro veteribus Helvetiorum
injuriis populi Romani, ab iis poenas bello repetisset, tamen
eam rem non minus err usu terrae Gallia, quarn populi Rc·
mani accidisse, propterea quod eo consilio florentissimis rebus
domos suas Helvetii reliquissent, uti toti Gallia bellum in-
ferrent, imperioque potirentur, locumque domicilio ex magna
copia deligerent, quem ex omui Gallia opportunissimum ac
fructuosissimum judicassent, reliquasque civitates stipen-
diarias haberent.'' Petierunt, ⁴‘ uti sibi concilium totius Gallice
in diem certam indicere, idque Caesaris uoluntate facere
