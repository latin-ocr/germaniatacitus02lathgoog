'l'heee countriee have never been known to be more German
than ut present, and at present they are Slavonic. At the
same time, I believe that there are traditione among the pre-
sent Tshekhs, which refer te their conquest of the country and
the usurpation of their anceetors. The velue of these depende
upon their nationality. This may be absolute. It may, on
the other hand, be of the same velue ae the traditione about
Brut being the patriarch of the Britona or, in other words,
the legend may be more due to the iulluence of u medieval
Latin literature, than the truly native traditione.

Having thus enumerated the countriee which were as much
(or mera) Slavonic a thousand years ago as they are now, I
snbjcin same ef the chief extracta that prove their having been
eo—all of them being taken hom Zeuss, and those only being
selected which the date accompanies, and where there ie,
besides this, the special statement that the population in ques·
tion was Slavonic.

The latest noticee corne first. They are chiefly from Adam
of Bremen and Helmoldne, and apply to the Slavonians ef
the northern srontier.
