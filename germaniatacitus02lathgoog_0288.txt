Ziucari,· of which the second clement is the word decantabimus,
and the first the root Teut, with the first ι changed, and the latter
ejected. of these three changes it is only the second that is, etymo·
logically‚ objectionable. The decomposition ol' the word into aare
÷a prefixed noun is almost certainly correct. The change from ι ιο
s is nothing moro than what the difference between a High German
and Low German form leads us to expect The ejection of ths
seoond ι, and the connection thereby affected with the root Tect- is
illegitimate.

3. That the Old High German proper names Zeto, Ζοοο,
and Zeno and the Frisian form Tuta are the sameas Teat- in
Teuma. ’

4. Thai Zum=Zuro=tho= Tatta=Tettt= in Tectoc=Noitt in
Ncitlwsses=Zeuss :-“ Und dann ist auch der familienname Zeuss in
nener form der alte namo ι’ When a man is investigating the etymo·
logy of his own name we must allow him more than usual latitude.

⁹Herlbum.]-·Another reading alsensem, and that in good MSS.

N erertheless‚ the probability of a form in b being preferable is so
great, as, perhaps, to justify us in assuming it ιο be the right one

The words Terram matrerm when compared with our own word
cont, the AngloSaxon corps, the Old High German crde, the Moeso·
Gothic atrebas almost force upon us the reading H erutum.

As cautious, however, against disposing of the N thus summarily,
we hare the following facts :-

1. The fact of there being noH in any of the German equivalents

ω {abilis fact of there being in the Eddaic mythology a deity named

N idrdr.

And against the conclusion that, eren if the reading be b, the
goddess must necessarily be Hertbo=ldacth is the existence of au
AngloSaxon deity hirspe, with different attributes.

Still Ι think Tmo Moter=Motber Eunt.

¹0Imalri.]-Heligoland.

1¹0aecoe]-The German Ocean. The name Helig·ii=holp «ιιι
farours this view
The term Oceani does the same. Nevertheless‚ it is applied ιο

the Baltic also.
