¹ Ciemrfl-'l'm first great lact in the history of the Cherusci is,
that they vvere the consedentes ol Arminius, and the conquerors oi
Varus. ’

'l'he next is thet they vvithstood the aggressione of their own
countrymen as stecdily es they did those ol Rome.

The Cherusci are mentioned by Cesar, and mentioned es the
hereditary enemies of the Susvi. The Cherusci, too, it vras vrho
first checked the conquests and consolidatione of Maroboduus.

We may look upon the Cherusci* as the heeds ofe great conseder-
ation, not only on the strength os their history, buton the evidence
of ancient writers, cy, Strabo, oi Χηροῦσκοι καὶ oi τούτων ὑπήκοοι
-Ταοίὺιιε, “ Cherusci, sociique coramss’

If so, the impert of the name may fluctuate, and sometimes mean
a particular people, sometimes serve as e collective designation, in·
cluding several such smaller divisione. 'Phis assumption cases many
difficulties-perhaps, indeed, itis absolutely necessary. We hear so
continnally of great natione, like the Chatti, Cherusci, Sigambri and
others, being conterminous, that, ifvre take the texts wherein such
notices occur literally, wc lesve no room ior several minor natione or
tribes.

Thus, in the present instance, there are special statements which
bring the Cherusci-

c As fur south ss the Chatti.

b. As far north es the Chauci.

c. As lar west as the Sicambri.

What room does this leave for such populations as the Chamavi,
Angrivarii, Fosi, dcci Little, if any, especially if vve bring in

ὓ The iull impert ol the Chernscsn resistanee to Rome, the velue oi the
patriotisrn ol Arminius, and the extent to which the Cheruscas glcry is ss
much English ss Germsn, cre well developcd in Professor Cressy's “ The
Filteen Decisive Battles ci the World,'' ioremost amongst which he places
the deleat oi the legions oi Varus.
