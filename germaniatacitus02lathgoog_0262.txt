clement rs not so clear. considering the nature of the Frisieu
ιοιιιοιο, l believe it to represent the word reen=seri. This, however,
is but a guess

The Frisinn characteristic alluded ιο ebore ιο-

1. The great prepondersnoe of compound words, ending iu the
equivalent ιο the English -baou, and German brim-eg„ 'l'hreeking-
bom, Oppendteim.

2. The peculier form this elementjtekes.

This is -οοη, the h being omitted, and the vowel being u.

In Frieslcnd itself so abundent cre these compounds cf -scus, that
two out of three (sixteen out of twenty-four) cs the places noted in
the map within slew miles of Leeuwerden, end in that element. ι

Zebud—Here but few words are compounded os the equivalent
ιο -dam end -deim at 2113 perhaps none except the word Ritttem,¹
which is in t and e.

Thus we have the two extremes3 te.. the Frisian topography at
its mammem in Friesland, end et its reinonem in Zeeland.

Between these two extremes the following is the order of transition.

erotem-Here the Frisien compound predomiuates, and that
with the Frisian form. In the offendissem of Appingadem only,
we have eighteen names in -ιιοι,

In Gmningen, however, we find occasion to mention another
Frisisn characteristic-the omission of -ot end en at the end of
words Hence, cll true Frisien compounds of etan end in ·mc,· es
Hettente aud Helberts·ma‚' whilst the numerous words that, in s
fen-country, ere compounded of dem, take such forms as the follow-
ing words in the arrorsdtssement of Wiuschoten—Holwierde (not
-deml, Utwier-da, dcc.

Now in Winschoten, although the Frisien characteristic of tbe
final -c be carried to a great extent, tbe forms in -cm are few. ln
the next province-

Drmtde-tbeydo not occurat ull. But Drenthe, lihe Winsohoten,
seems to be reclaimed land, end as such, the Ιιοιιιοι of e population
less aboriginel then that of Frieslend end Groningeu.

Obemeel.—o. Aarondstsement of Zenone-Here we have three
compounds of bns, νιος Blsnhen-lurm, Windesdeim, aud wile-cm
-cll three different3 one Saron, one German, and one Frisian.

¹ The mcp referred to is Van hengenheuzen’s, sm. 1843 ; the scale being
aemcll quarto pege to each Prorinee. No topographicsl knowledge beyond
whet is thus supplied is pretended ιο.
