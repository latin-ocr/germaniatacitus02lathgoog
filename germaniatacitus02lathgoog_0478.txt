Over many landa, Ligbt and life together.

Words of thanks utter, Has, under heaven,
Always south or north Substantisl glory.”

On the Evideuce of a (lonnection between the Cimbri and
the Chersonesus Cimbrica. By Dr. It. G. Latham.

lt is considered that tbe evidence of auy local connection
between the cimbri conquered by Marius, and the (lher-
souesus Cimbrica, is insufficient to counterbalance the natural
improbability of a long aud difficolt national migratiou. Of
such a connection, however, the identity of name and the oon-
curreut belief of respectable writers are primd socie evidence.
This, however, is disposed of, if such a theory as the following
can be established, oia, that, for certain reasons, the know·
ledge of the precise origin and locality of the natious con·
quered by Marius was, at an early period, confused and inde·
finite; that new countries were made known without giving
any further information; that hence, the locality of the Cimbri
was always pushed forwards beyond the limits of the geogra-
phical areas accurately ascertained3 and finally, that thus
their supposed locality retrograded contiuually northwards,
until it fixed in the districts of Sleswick and J utlaud, where
the barrier of thesea, and the increase of geographica] know-
ledge (with one exception) prevented it from getting farther.
Now this view arises out of the examinatiou of the language

of the historiens aud geographers as examined iu order, from
Sallust to Ptolemy.
