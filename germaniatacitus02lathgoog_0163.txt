Far too many inquirere either adopt cr acquiesce in the current
noticn that migratione are phenomcna, which ue may assume ιο any
extent required, not only on account cf the facts demanding explana-
tion, but in order to sustain the accuracy of even indifferent authors.
Το such, it is as easy to bringa population from the Baltic ιο the
Mediterranean, across a whole series oi hostile countries‚ as ιο move

. a knight across a chess-board. she great name of Niebuhr justifies

this gratuitons prodigality of lcccmoticn. Nay more, it seems so
philosophis ιο trace a socalled national movement ιο ite primary
cause, that a known invasion in one quarter is often supposed ιο
justify the assumption of an unknown one elsewhere-so that
natione prese each other forwerda, themselves being pressed upon.
This doctrine, with metaphora and illustratione to match, is plausible
enough ιο be widely recognised.

It means, in its naked form, that a attacks n, became he cannot
support himself against o, ο being similarly situated in respect to
n,and so on 3 arisw which males the great qualification for the

This doctrine we would gladly believe to be true. It would
diminish by nine-tantbs the crimes os the warlilrs part of the human
species. It would reduce all but the first primas-y movemsnts ιο a
matter os necessity, and so justify them. 'l'hc motivas for aggree

sion would not be envy, cruelty, and cupidity, but the unpleasant
necessity of chooeing between separation for what bas been lost to
yourself by the appropriaticn cf what belongs to another, und death
or bondage.

A little anslysis, and a few distinctions, will show that, instead of
migratione being thus common, they are eminently rare.

Amiprats'oa is different from amere extensiones frontier. No
one says, that when the whole American population presses west·
warde, at the rate of (say) twelve miles a year, there is a migration.
The frontier has been advanoed 3 the advancing population being
continuom with the stationsry, and no separationes one portion oi
the American population from another having taken place. 'Phe
Ruseisns are gradually enerosching upon the Siberians 3 and the ,
English on the Weleh 3 yet none of these areiustancss of migration.
