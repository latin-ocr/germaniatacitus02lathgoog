moribss the construction oi the limes Romanoa to Domitian. Why
then nse such epithets ae probably? Nine-tenths oi the admitted

’ facts in history, is less supported by evidence than the reduction of

the Decumates agri, anterior to the reign of Nerva. This isa
point to which eren the present passage bears testimony.

Under Nerva there was a “ little war in Suahia, the only truce oi
which existe in an inscription, in which mention is made of a eic-
lers'o Soeoicu.” Thin was iu 97 or 89, nn-Niebuhr’s-Leotures.

Under Trajan and Adrion, the relations between Rome and Ger·
many were peacefuL—Ditto.

In the reign of Antoninus Pius “we hear of a defensive war
against the custus-Diuo.

The great Marcomannio war characteriaed the reign of Aurelius
Antoninus. ln this, the tribes on the Decumatian frontier took
some, but not the main, part. This was chiefly in the hands of the
Gemens os the Slnvonio Marches-the agri Decumates being a
Gallie or Romano-Gallio one.

Commodus purchased an absence from hostilities, and Severus,
probably, orerawed them. Ae any rate, we hear nothing ol German
ware in his reign.

One of the titlee of Caracalla presente us, for the first time, with
the important epithetdleroooaieas. How it was earned we learn
hom the following extract-‘⁴ Antoninus, Caracalla dictus. . . .
Almsoooos, gentem populosum, ex equo mirifice pugnantem, prope
Mrenum amnem devicit.”-Aur. Victor, de Caes. c. 21. Δ

This is the first time the important name Alcameni occurs, and

lor that reason the notice of the agri Decumates has been brought
down thus low (an. 215); since the agri Decumates, and the parts
to the north and east of them, form the great Alemannio area.

Further notice of these Germane will be found in Ερὶἰῳωηεηα,

In saying that “in the time ol Tacitus the agri Decumates had
been appropriated by Rome,’' I mean not that it was settled, or
organized‚ but that it was kept as a Marcii or military frcotier. A
debatable land of this kind is the Snevic Waste, aa described by
Caesar. Ι believe that at the present moment a portion of the
Austrian and Ottoman frontier is in this condition-oia, Turkieh
Oroatia, between Austrian Oroatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia‚ and
Slavonia

Politically, the Deramutes agri coincide with the modern Duchy oi
