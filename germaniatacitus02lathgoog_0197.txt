Instead, then, of doubtfully suggesting the identity of δέκα and
Isis, name for name, aeis done by (trium, Ι have no hesitation in
assenting to it.

Whether traces of the characteristic accipiam ean be found

in an equally satisfactory form, is another question. A long
quotation from Redolf'a Ohroniele of the Abbey of St. Trudo,

is to be found in D. M. i. pp. aar-241. It tells us that, an.
1133, the country-pecple of the neighbourhood made a ship, put it
on wheels‚ rolled it about from town to town, and attended it with
song and danae from Tongres to Louvaiu.

This was done to annoy the weavers. It also annoyed the
clergy. So much so, that such expressions as anacim infausto oraine
compactam —9adilitcte's stodiam—profanes simmaeri canabina-bor·
teboatcr at comburatur-cmlipai spiritus qai ia itte ferebantur·—
icsausti ominis monetam, dac, occur in the account

Ι agree with Grimm in thinking thia particular processioa,
although mentioned as a single instance, to have been but the last
of many previous ones—in other words, a revivat of an old custom.

Ι also believe its origin tc have been pagan.

But Ι am not satisfied that it has anything to do with either
fais or Ziza.

a. 'Phe locality of the processioa was the parts about the Iaower
Rhine and Mosella, that of Ziza, Bavaria, and that of ewen thaisis
of Tacitus the country of only para suevorum, so that whilst the
deity is preeminently local, the custom is spread over a vast
area.

b, Processions of the kind in question are common, without being
connected with one another. 'l'he celebration of the breaking-up of
the ice, and the beginning of the season for navigation might easily
be celebrated on the Danube aud on the Rhine with a similar cere-
monial, without the necessity of supposing the one to have borrowed
the custom from the other.

Something of this kind Ι imagine to have been tho ease with the
supposed analogne of the accipiam faidis in Germany, beate being .
wheeled about at the beginning of the sailiug eeason, just as on the
9th of J anuary, or Plocph·Mouday, the labouring men of some parts
of England go about as Ploapbboys, or Ploagd-bulloclrs

'lhat either the Isis of Tacitus, or the Ziza * of the Augsburgers

' Supposing theru (es 1 do not) to be different datiae.
