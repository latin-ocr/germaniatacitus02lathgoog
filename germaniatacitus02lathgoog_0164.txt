one would call the retreat of the ten thousand Greeks a migratchn
in the usual sense of the term.

s In order to even approach the idea of a true migration, there
must bc a freed country5 and there must be a dominata! of arco
as well. In other words, emigration implies the occupation of one
area by the inhabitants of another, combined with the noreoccupotion
of tlte interuenicy parts. Without this latter clement, itis amere
extension ol frontier. To apply an illustration already mades
migration is like the knights necve at chess.

- If these interpreting parts be portions of the ocean, or a river, their
non-occupatior is a matter of ooume 3 and hence, migratione by
water are common. li, however, they be hy aad, they arc so rare
that, throughout 11oe sobole history of tlae &macra neck, I know rso
umcepsionatle instance osone.

Theodorias conquest of Rome was as little a migration as the

The AngIoSaxon migration was by sea,· and that the Gothic,

For a migration ιο be unesceptiorscble‚ the evidence of its occur-

rence must be anaceptioracble also; i.e., it must be referablo to ’

contemporary testimony. This is because migration was as laroritc
a mode oi accounting sor the more irregular distributions ol popula·
tion with ancient writers as it is with modern.

The differencc between migratione and great military movements
is difficult to drav. If, however, we choose to distinguish between
an army with a number oi camp-sonorem, and a migration properly
socelled, by considering that the presence of females‚ aged men,
and children, is necessary to constitute the latter (making it a move·

ment, πανδημεί) the rarity of this presumedly common phenomenon
isindefinitely enhanced -so much so, theta land migration (as
distinguished from one by water), a migration with separation from
the original area (as distinguished from mere advance of frontier)‚ a

migration to a fresh land (as distinguished from a return), and
a migration πανδημεί (as distinguished frome multitudinous army)
