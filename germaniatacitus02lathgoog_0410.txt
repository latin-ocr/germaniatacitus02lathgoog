Procopius makes them (lotha but his langnage may apply
to their political relations. besides which, he connects them
wilh the Voodols, and says thar they were originally called
Sauromata and Μιίαοοίιίσηί-Γοτθικὰ ἔθνη πολλὰ μὲν καὶ

ἄλλα πρότερόν τε ἦν καὶ τανῦν ἐστι, τὰ δὲ δὴ πάντων
μέγιστά τεκαὶ ἀξιολογώτατα Γότθοι τέ εἶσι καὶ Βανδίλοι
καὶ Οὐῑσίγοτθοι καὶ Γηπαιδες. Πάλαι μέντοι Σαυρομάται
καὶ Μελάγχλαινοι ὠνομάζοντο· εἰσὶ δὲ ol καὶ Γετικὰ ἔθνη
ταῦτ’ ἐκάλουν. Οὗτοι ἅπαντες ὀνόμασι μὲν ἀλλήλοιν δια-
φέρουσιν, ὥσπερ εἴρηται, άλλιρ δὲ τῶν πάντων οὐδενὶ
διαλλάσσουσι. Λευκοὶ γὰρ ἅπαντες τὰ σώματά τέ εἱσι καὶ
τὰς κόμας ξανθοὶ, εὐμήκεις τε καὶ ἀγαθοὶ τὰς ὄψεις, καὶ
νόμοις μὲν τοῖς αὐτοῖς χρῶνται, ὁμοίως δὲ τὰ ἐς τὸν θεὸν
αὐτοῖς ἤσκηται. Τῆς γὰρ Ἀρείου δόξης εἰσιν ἅπαντες, φωνή
τε αὐτοῖς ἐστι μία, Γοτθικὴ λεγομένη, καί μοι δοκοῦν ἐξ ἑνὸς
μὲν εἶναι ἅπαντας τὸ παλαιὸν ἔθνους, ὀνόμασι δὲ ὕστερον
τῶν ἑκάστοις ἡγησαμένων concepturae—Bell. Vandal. i. 2.

Πολλῷ δὲ ἄποθεν (τῆς Μαιώτιδος) Γότθοι τε καὶ Οὐῐσίγοτθοι
καὶ Βανδίλοι καὶτὰ ἄλλα Γοτθικὰ γένη ξύμπαντα ἵδρυντο.
—Bell Goth. iv. 5.

He adds, too, Σκίῤῥους τε καὶ Ἀλανο ὺς καὶ ἄλλα Γὸτθικα
sem-Bell. Goth. i. 1. Now the Alans were, assuredly,
no Goths in ethnology. See ᾗ Abroi.

The evidence, then, in favour of their being Gotho or
Germana, is thar of so many others. Their alliances, aud the
names of some of their leaders, along with a(socalled) tra·
dition are in their favour; their locality against thom. So
is the gloss Gopootu. So is the express evidence of Procopius.

These are first mentioned by Mamertinus, sn. 291 ι their
locality being on the Middle Danube, and their chief political
relations with the Ἠιοντίαρι, Ϋαηάαίο, Gepida, Orare-Gella,
and Limipaoae.

Zosimus, an indifferent authority, makes them Scythicus:
-Ἐττελθόντων δὲ Θαῑφάλων, Σκυθικοῦ γένους, ἱππεῦσι
πεντακοσίοις, οὐ μόνον οὐκ ἀντετάξατο τούτοις, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ

πολι) τῆς δυνάμεως άττοάαλὼν, καὶ τὰ μέχρι τοῦ χάρακος
