o. Francos is cithera clerical error, or a mistalse sor franco.

1. Franco 1111111111 used by the Franks, from whom it took
its name.

I will lay before 111 rsader all that can be said in favour of this view.

α. As admitted, 111 change from fr· to pfr- is not 11 1 common
kind.

1. 11 theold uncial MS. NG and M are 11111 confused.

c. Franco in single-Saron, and frutico in Norse=jooelin.

d. ’111 Spaniards called oxessrasctscoe aster the Franks-“secures
-qun et Hispani ab usu Francorum, per derivationem Froocs'scoc
vocant-’'-Isid Hispal. xviii. 6, 3.

Observa, that iu this last case, the writer who finds 11 1111111111,
as too unlilre a doqycr to connect psrs'enw with framea, finds no dif-
ficulty in connecting 11 111 with a jocelin.

Observa, too, that franciscam an adjective, can, at best, but
mean the Ir‘rookish weopoa.

of the AngloSaxon and Norse forms, france and frolles, I by no
means undervalue the importance.

Now 111 os look to the assumptione requisita for this view.

In Juvenal the word occurs, throughout the MSS, as franssa.

In Tacitus it occurs seven times, aud, throughout the MSS, as
framea.

Surely the lihelihood 11 111 Μ becuming Nc, as opposed to this,
is only a presumption against 11111.

But the first Roman writer who, by using the word, introduced
it into Rome, may have written framea for franco, and so the error
have been propagated. This, I submit, is only valid against some·
thing else equally hypothetical. Itis not enough to say that an
author may blunder. If it were so, any man might believe or
disbelieve what he chooses. The particular likelihood of each
blnnder must be shown.

Still the assumption may possibly be legitimate; since it is pos·
11111 1111 111 hypothesis, which arises out 11 them, may clear away
numerous and considerable difficulties, do away avith numerous and

considerable improbabilities, and so gain credenee on the strength 11
111 phenomena for which it vill account.

111 us see what is done in this way.

It does just the contrary to what it ought.

The Franks, under the name 11 Frosrk, appear in history, for
111 first time, in the secossd century-no earlier.
