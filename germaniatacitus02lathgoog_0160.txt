the quotation from Nestor* runs, “Ot siohzlre lxx i dwn joryleu
byst joryk Slovenaslr,”= From snoh lxx and two tongam is the
Slovenian toayae.

The Bohemians and Morarians eall themselves oacaky Gosylt
and Moraosley Gorys respectively.

As this may† safely be considered to be theJaryy· in Joryyss, it
isasound inferenoe to presume the existence of a Slavonio popula·
tion whenever that name ooours.

¹⁰ Doos'a.]-Anoient Dacia oomprises the modern principalities of
Wallachia and Moldavia ; and it is these two oountries whioh more
strongly remind us of the Deoia oi Trajan and Deoebalua Here it
is where the languags ol the Romans still remains 3 so that the pre·
sent Ronmsy of the Lower Danube belongs to the same philologioal
division with the French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Grison ,-
· in other words, it is one of the daughters of the great Latin tongua.

But ancient Deoia oomprised something more than Wallaohia
and Moldavia All Trsnsylvsnia, at least hali the Banat, and at
least hali the rest of Hungary‚ belonged to it. Half-way between
the 'l’hiess and the Trsnsylvanian boundary, runs a line os supposed
Roman remains, and these most probably separated the Roman pro
rinoe of Dacia from the independent J azyges Metanastoe oi the 'l'hiesa

Now this was a politioal division ς but the politieal division does
not reaoh lar enough west. In order to bring Deoia in eontaot
with Germania, we must make an ethnologiosl frontier, and seeh
for Dacians beyond the provinoe of Daoia Thia is easily done,
sinoe the name was one or* a widely-spread and only partiallyoon-
quered population. 'l'ha Daoi os the text—the Daoi os tha Germanic
frontier-were what Zeuss oalls the indepmdeat Daoians ( freis
Duker), and their looality was the Gallieian side of Hungary. They
are said by Pliny to hare originally oooupied the valley of tha
hibiscus, from whioh they were expelled'by the J azyges.

¹¹ Morstibaa.]-This means the Medres Range and the northern
continuation of the Bakonyer wald, the frontier being that of the Ger-
mans and Dacians, rather than that of the Germana and Sarmata.
