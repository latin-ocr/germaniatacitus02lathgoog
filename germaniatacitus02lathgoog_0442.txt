worshippers of Terra Mater, would have passed for outlying
Frisians, outlying Chauci, or outlying Gherusei3 for anything
rather than the representatives of a separate substantive
branch of the great Saron, or Frisian, or Saxo-Frisian
division of the Germanic tongue.

This the Anyti represent; but how far they do so single-
handed, or how far the Eudoaes and other populations of d xc.
do the same, is uncertain.

Ι think they do not do so exaotly.

l. Το begin with the Varini, whose relations to the Asyli,
as already hasbeen indicated, are eminently difficult-

The mention of them along with the Angli, is a presnmp
tion that they were what the Aoylos were.

Their common worship of the goddess Horrta is a specific

fact3 und if it were a fact beyond doubt, there would be no
fair reasons for refining on the natural inference from the text
of Tacitus3 in other words, although there would still be a
balanos of conflioting difficulties, the evidence of a German
object of worship, with a German name, in a German island,

would ontweigh the presumptioni arising from the Warwuoi
of authentis history being unaquivocally Slavonie.

But the fact is not beyond impeachment; since we can find
the elements of a natural and excusable error in the peculiar
characteres the cultas of the Angli on one side, aad the
Varini on the other.

What if the Varini had one dely mhrotd, and the Anyti
another-so that the inmte suere, with their corresponding
ousta aemma, were two in number. Isubmit that a writer,
with no better means of knowing the exact truth than Tacitus,
might, in such a case, when he recognized the iosolur charae-
tercommon to the two forms of cultos, easily and pardonably,
refer them to one and the same island: in other words, he
might know the general fact that the Anyti and Varini
worshipped in an island, without knowing the particular fact
of their each having a separate one.

This is what really happened: so that the hypothesis is as
follows :—

a. The truly and undoubtedly Germanic Asyli worshipped
in Heligoland.
