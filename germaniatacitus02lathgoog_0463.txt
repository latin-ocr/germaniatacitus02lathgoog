languages coming from Europe. Of course, there are reasons
for thie onesidcduess, and, amouget these, the reasonable
doctrine that the human species originated in Asia, the
somcwhat crude notion that migratione move from east to
west, rather than from vvest to east, as isin ohedience to some
ethuological law, aud the unwillingness to believe that the
primary migratione by which the populatiou of the earth'e
surface spread from some single point over the four quartere
’ of the world, lie far beyond any exietiug means of iuvestiga-
tiou, are the chief.

Nevertbeless if we clear our minds of all thie, the presump-
tione are the other way.

When two allied populations, covering areas of different
magnitudee‚ are separated from each other, aud we account
for the separation by assuming a migratiou, the presumptiou
is that the occupante of the smaller area are derived from that
of the larger, rather thau cicc orroei.

When au ethuological class falls into a certain number of
divisione, the portion of ite area, where the divisione are the
most numerous aud the most definite, must he considered as
the oldest. '

Such are the praetitulatione—presumptione which we get at
by attending to the first principles of reasouing-presumptione
which our common-sense supplies us with. No one, lima·
gine, will deuy their ywrcral validity, however much he may
consider that, in certain individual cases, they give ns a wrong
result.

Thus, taken ly iteels, the presumptiou that ariees from the
vast extent over which the English language is spolreu iu
America, as compared with the limited area of the Britieh
Ielee, is iu favour of the American being the mother-tougue,
which ie lruowu to be contrary to fact.

But the mere question of a magnitude of area need not be
taken ty iteelf. It is corrected by the presumptiou arising
out of the second observatiou. In Ameriea, the English
lauguage stands either alone or nearly so. In Englaud it hae
its ooopenerc aronnd it,—Frisiau, Dutch, Platt-Deuteeh,
High German, and Norser aud this shows that Europe ie
the older hume of the Englishmau.
