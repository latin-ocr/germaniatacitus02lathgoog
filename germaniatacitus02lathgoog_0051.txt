The third chapter has served to illustrato the principles of
ethnological classificationr since it has shown that notioris as
different as the lcelauder and the Swiss may be comprized
in ono general division ; iu other words that a stoclc comprises
populations as different from each other as the Bavarians, the
Dutch, the Swedes, the Faroe lslanders and the Americans
of the United States. Hence the Gothic stoclr is oco of the
stocks of which we have a pretty clear idea.

Another such a stoclr is the chawent. This comprises the
Latius aud Greeks-ancient and modern. Besides which it,
to a certain extent, comprises the Spaniards, the Portu-
guese, the French, certain Swiss populations, and the Wal-
lachiaus ; in all of which countries the language is derived from
the Latiur the populatiou being mixed, is, partly consisting
of Roman, partly of aboriginal blood. Now, recoguising the
grean Classical stoclr as au ethnological equivalent to the
Gothic, and comparing the extent to which a Wallachian
differs from au Italian or a modern Greek of the other, we
have u convenient measure of the import of tho word stocks
since we see the amount of difference implicd by it.

* l'r'z. by that divisiones the European populations which, within the his·
toricnl period, hon retrcotrd bolore tho Germanic rathcr than cncronchcd on it.
