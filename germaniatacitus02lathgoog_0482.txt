of any intermediate portion of that area being possessed by
tribes as alien to each other as the Gauls aud Germana. Hence, ’
therefore, the fact of the cimbri being Kelts will (if proved)
he considered as making against the probability of their origin
in the (limbric Chersonese3 whilst, if they be shown to be
(iotha, the difficulties of the supposition will be iu some degree
diminisbed. Whichever way this latter point is settled, some-
thing will be gained for tha historian3 sinos the supposed
presence of Kelts in the Oimbric Chersoneso has complicated
more than one question in ethnography.

Previous to proceeding in the iuquiry, it may he well to lay
down, once for all, as a postulate, thot whatever, iu the way
of ethnngmphy, is proved concerning any one tribe of the
Cimbro-Teutonis bagua, must be considered as proved con-
ceming the remainder; since all explanatione, grounded upon
the idea that one part was Gothic and another part Keltic,
have a certain amount of prima socie improbability to set
asido. The same conditione as to the hurdeu of proof apply
also to any hypothesis founded ou the uotiou of rotirioy Gimbn‘
posterior to the attempted invasion ol Italy. On this point
the list of authors quoted will not be brought below the time
of Ptolemy. With the testimonias anterior to that writer,
bearing upon the question of the ethnography‚ the attempt,
however, will be made to be exhaustive. Furthermore‚ as the
question in hand is not so much the absolute fact as to whe-
ther the Cimbri were Kelts or Goths, but one as to the amount
of evidence upon which we believe them to be either the one
or the other, statements will be noticed under the head of
evidence, not bacam they are really proofs, but simply
because they have ever been loolred upon as such. Beginuiog
then with the Germanic origin ol the Cimbro-Teutonis coufe-
deration, and dealing separately with such tribes as are sepa-
ratcly mentioned, we first liud the
