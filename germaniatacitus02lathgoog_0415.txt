Thia, however, cau be reconciled with previous passages, by
considering the Atticm-as (or Gardioyor) to have been a free
company, recruiting itself on Slavonic ground, so much ao
aa to form the Germanicnuclcaa to what was really a Vandal
(or Slavonic) force.

The Laoaings, mentioned also by Dion, may have been
similar adventurers.

Hence the names Genaerio, hc, are the names ol Astiags
(or Gurdinya); and tho German blood amongst the Vandals
was limitati to the cognatio or silaooufl of their German
leadera; aud the Vandals are German only so far as they
are Astings-which is only very partially.
