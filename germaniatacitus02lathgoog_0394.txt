been removed from the lower Rhine to Burgundy, as colo-
nists‚ and to have settled ou the Doubs.

From the end of the eigbth century downwerds‚ the notioes
of apcpua, and comitatae Attuaricrraa are numerous-the
locality being the valleya of the Vincenne, Tille, and Bene,
and tbe neighbouring parts of tbe water-system of the
Doubs.

The papae Oommaoorum joined the pagus Attuariorom on
the Doubs, even as the areae of the Otcmuaa' aud Attuarii
were conterminous on the Lower Rhine. For the numerous
references to these interesting settlemeuts‚ see Zeuss, pp. 582
-584. They deserve more attention from local antiquariae
than they bave found.

111. Tbe Χοιτούωροι ⁰s Pirama-This writer, who says
nothing about any Chattuarii on the Lower Rhine, places a
population with a name so like it as Xarr-oriorpor on the part
between the Upper Rhine and Danube, amougst the Dan·
duti, Turones, Merovingi, aud other widely different sections
of the Germanic population3 and, to add to the confusion,
he places Κασ-ουάροι not very far from Χαιτ-ούωροι.

Is this to be put down to erroneous information, and to
pass as inaccuraoyl Probably. At the same time an
intrusiones Chatti, from the southern portion of their area
may have taken place, and tho name Olera, or Chasuarii
(Huzai or Haza-ocrii) heve thus originated. The Low
German form in ·t-, however, is against this view.

The fact of an inaccuracy is the likelier.

I. The duaci os &mdia-The name of the country called
Suabia is a true ethnological term, even as Frcaecaic is one.
The one meana the country occupied by the Saevi, the other
the country occupied by the Froalca. Bouaria is another
such name, derived from the Boii. Scaoop is in a similar,
though somewhat different, predicament. They all, however,
agree in being names of countries derived from their po-
pulations. Haase is, probably, the same, and Thariapia
also.
