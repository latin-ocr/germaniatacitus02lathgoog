uorse ou securos ur. 59

in the time of Tacitus, we know nothing: neither oen we speculate
as ιο the nature of the events ou which they were based.

Thai the periods, however, found in the text before ns (like
the present word seven-supha ee'nnipht) which we suppose ιο have
been designated by some compound oi the word -aiqlu, were shorter
’ than those of the months, is nearly certain.

Mona is so truly a word olGerman origin, and so definitely
connected with moon, that we may safcly believe that the natural
periodos twenty-eight days was always recognised‚ aud always called,
as at present In other words, it is unlikely that the name lor
maath should hare been the oompound, or combinationes the root
apt in question.

still less is it likely that the oempound in question was applied
ιο a longer period than that of the mouth.

That the mouth then was divided into smaller periods is the fair
inference from the present passage—and that the quarters os the
moon were the phenomena which determined their length, is also
likely.

Still the German equivalent ιο the Roman nundine, and the
Christian week, is a point which has still to be investigated.

That such prominence should be giren ιο the rechoning by nepeta
if it merely meant that where a Roman said so many days a German
said so many ar’phta, is unlikcly. There was, surely, some period of
time designated by the root aqasseither a woorercl or some similar
compositional element
