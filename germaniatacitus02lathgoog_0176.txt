of the Germanic population over these two divisions of country was—

a For the forest districts-the ancestors of the MoesoGoths and
the High German ; their area being Thuringia, Suebis, Franconia,
Hesse.

b. For the fers-districts-tbe Frisians proper aud the Ohauc'a

c. Dirided between the two-the Old Saxons and some of the
how Germane 3 the Wssterwald (saduc recompensa) being within
their limits.

Ol the two representatires of these two physical divisione, the
extreme types were, perhaps, the F ranconians and Frieslandera

An important modification of the country, however, is not com-
prehended within these two denominatione, ιο. the sandy heaths arrd
barrenses Hauover; indeed, as they lay beyond the area habitually

. traversed by the Romans, they were, probably, unknown ιο Tacitus.

These, when they attain their maximum of elevation aud sterility-
aa is the ease with the Liineburg Heath—have besa allowed to con-
stitute the nearest approach to be found in Europe of the Steppc,
so characteristic of Central and N orthern Asia.

'l'he population that most closely coincided with this division, as

far as itwas German at all (and not Slavonic), was the hogio-Saxon.

‘Ec opes mrt.]—'l'hat the German cattle was almost wholly
kim and occa (to the comparative exclusion of decep) is the na-
tural insereuce from the absence ol the word propes, and the pro-
minenoe giren ιο amentis ; an inference strengthened by the notice
cl the German dress, the materiale οἰ which were either flacce or
mrtem ,· no mention being made of wool.

Again, it is a remark of Mr. Gamett's, that, in the present Eng-
lish, the words connected with the arts of weacirm and manley ars
Keltic rather than Germani03 ay„
