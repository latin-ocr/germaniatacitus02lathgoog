it deuotes the Frisii of Tacitus, the present Frieslanders cf Friesland,
with a anicianum amount os alteration.

As to whether the name itself be German, it would be an unne-
cessary retinement ιο doubt it. N evertheless, the criticism which
applies ιο the word Saevi is applicable to Frisii also. It is applica·
bie,· but, although applicable, it by no means follows that it should
be applied. By considering the term as Keltie a few difficulties rc·
specting the connection between the Frisii and Chauci might, per-
haps, be removed. On the other hand, we have Pliny's word Frisia-
conen a compound almost certainly German.

The shadow of uncertainty that rests over the langnage to which
the root Fris· belongs, is created by the fact cf the Friaii being
mentioned by Caesar, under the name now before us: for Oasar's
informante were Gauls, and, Ι am inclined to think that, aa c geae-
ral eale, the Gallie name of a Germanic population was different
from the native one.

Again ; the name of the national hero is so often the name cf the

peoplc who are addicted ιο his eabae-in other words, the national
hero is so often an epewyraua ιο the watien-that when this is not
the case, a slight presumption is raised against the name being

indigemus, native, and vernacular. l'his is the case here. Fhe
great mythological Frisian is Ficta. We should expect some such

name as Fris.
Thus, in the Traweller’s Song, we have-

“ Fin Folo-walding
[Wetld] Fresna cynne-‘’
“Finn, the sih of Folcwalda

(Ruled) the race of Frisians.”

All this, however, may be, and probably is, over-refluement.

Fhe later form which the word Frisii takes is one in -ea, the so·
called weak form of the Gothic grammaticus. Hence, whilst Tacitus,
Pliny, Ptolemy, and Dion, write Frisii, Φρίσσιοι, and Φριισιοι, Proco-
pius has Φρίσσονες.

Fhe AngloSaxou writers also use the form in -αο ,· eg„ Fracte
in Beda, and Frisan in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

'Fhe form Frate-borres, in Pliny, has been already noticed. Itis

clearly a compound. The power and original form cs the second
