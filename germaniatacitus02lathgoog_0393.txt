In this case, Chattuarii isthe Low German form of a name
of the Marsi and others, taken from the forest district they
occupied—just as numerous minor tribes might be called
‚Hercynia or Boceaio, from the Hercyniae or Buconica
foreste.

But it may also indicate a settlement of intmsive utam
from Hesio, and the name be newer than the population.

I inclinato the former of these views; still admitting the
difficulty involved in the fact of populations with names so
like as Uluti-uarii (= Occi-cola), Olus-uarii (occupante of the
Haec), and uteru (occupante of Hesse) being socalled, inde·
pendent of any special connection.

The hypothesis that the ailon Casio wasa common rather
than a proper name, and, as such, one which might ocem in
more districts thau one, would solve the difficulty. The
solution, however, is, at best, but hypothetical. If valid,
however, Hoste itself might be but a siloc Ocra-io, just aa
Borpnody was a Viryoot.

Hence, the Chattuarii wore High Germane or Low Ger·

name. Or they rnay have been modified High Germane-
High Germane in origin, bnt Low Germane in locality, and
several other characteristico.

We have seen that, although the word Chattuarii is not
the Low German form for the Otos-uarii of the Haeo, it is
something of the kind. It is the Low German name of the
Haza-carii of Eeecn, and the parts about that town.

If Low Germane, they were, probably, Plau-Dounon
rather than Saron, and Frieinn rather thau PlateDeutseh-
