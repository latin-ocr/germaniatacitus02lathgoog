PROLEGOMENA.

§xnn cnsaa's nomene or ran annulus.

Of so much more importance than the remarks of all other
writers upon Germany are those of Gaesar, that the chief
extracta from the Bellum Gallicum bearing upon that country
will be given io caleam. They require, however, certain
preliminary remarks.

First comes the distinction between what Ceasar ohserved
for himself and what he learned from others. Of these latter,
hia chief informante were Gauls, and chief amongst the Gauls,
most probably, Divitiacus the AEduan. The parts of Ger·
many which an AEduan would best understand would be
those of the Middle Rhine—Hesse, Franconia, aud the
northern parts of Suahia. The name by which these Ger·
mans were known was Saevi.

Another point to notice, is the likelihood of the Germana
thus described having spoken Gallio to the Gauls, instead of

the Gauls having learned German: inasmuch aethere is the ⁰

special statement that Ariovistus spoke the language of the
country he had invaded; and that it was in Gallie that he
made himself iutelligible to the Romans. There is no evi·
dence of any Gaul speaking German.

Hence, it will not be surprising if many -of the names in
Geesar are as little German as the name Welsh is Gambrian.
Without, at present, sayiug how far such is the case, it is

enough to remark that, amougst the German populations of ·

Gaesar, there is only one whereof the name is uneqnivocally
German, as tested by its structure and etymology. This
word is Marcomoaoi=Morolmea‚ or meo os the looadmiee.

Of the Germans of Ariovistus, Gaesar's knowledge was
persona13 hut these were intrnsive emigrante rather than
true Germana, aa, Germana in a Gellio locality, and (proha-
bly for that reason) partially Gallicised. The Germans for
the parts between Bonn and Nimcguen, were also similarly
known.

Lastly, be speaks from his study of previous writers,
quoting Eratosthenes for the extent and name of the
Hercynian forest.
