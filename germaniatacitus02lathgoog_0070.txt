great likelihood, because Ι am unwilling to overstate the case.
Morka of minor magnitude may have existed-marks between
different members of the same stock3 between, for instance,
the (latti and Cherusci, the Cherusci and Chauci, hc. This,
again, is what we find at home. The Welsh marchen sepa·
rated the Senon from the Kelt: the Scottish‚ the sonthron
Saxon from the northern. Still Ι think that the existence of
a march, sufficiently important to be mentioned hythe Roman
historiens, *is prima sacis evidence of the existence of an
ethnological difference of considerable magnitude.

3. The third is the linear character of the dimensione of a
march. A bonndary which separatas one area hom another
is surely narrower than either of the areas which it separatas.
A march as broad as it is long is no march at all. Το this,
however, there is an objection. One nation may so encroach
upon another that the march, or line oi bonndaries, is con-
tinnally advancing. Now if the name be retained whilst the
lias becomes protruded‚ the droadtl of a march may become
as notable as its length. Thus, if the North American
settlers had called each county which abutted on the Indian
frontier the march, and if those connties had retained their
names, there would now be a series of areas, so named,
reaching from the Atlantia to the Rocky Mountains. And
this is really the case in Germany‚ where we have the oldest
lineos frontier between the Slavonians und Gemens, called
All-mark (the old march); the next, Mittel-mark (the middle
march); and the third, Uckerwmrk the march of the Ucrii‘
(a Slavonic population so-called).

4. There is also another element oi uncertainty. Suppose
the Humber was calledthe river March. The people on it
might be called Morclmoa, though not on a march. ln snch
a case, certain Yorkshiremcn would appear to form the fron-
tier, when, really, they did not do so. By this, the writer
who argued from the name only would imagine that the
non-English urea began at Hull instead of ot Roxburgh3
and the English area would lose all Yorkshire‚ Dnrham, and
Nerthumberland.

Now, reverse this supposition‚ and let the Spey be called
the March. ln this case, the menon its banhs would appear
