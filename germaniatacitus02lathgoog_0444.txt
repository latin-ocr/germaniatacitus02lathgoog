reason against the Aviones having been Frisians‚ but no
reason against their having been Old Saxona.

But against this is Ptolemy's name Rotavtot and the
Κοὸανδοί lie northwards.

3. Whether the Eudoses are the same as the Φουνδούσιοι
(see not. in ξ xn.) is not a matter of indifference. By identifying
them, we ascertain the directionis not the exact locality of
the Εαῶοεοε. This is northwards, in the western part of the
Gimbrio Peninsula.

4. Whether the Saardoaos are the same as the Φαρό·
δεινοι (see notin § xa.) is still less a matter of indifferenee. By
identifying them we aseertain the directim, if not the exact
looality, of the Suaridones. This is wmwurds between the
Suedas and the Ololusus (Odore and Trave t). But then we
geta complication; since Soord· is generally considered to
be a German root, whereas the looality is Slavoniau.

That ard is really a German root is rendered probable by
the form Sacerci-weram the Traveller's Soug. But this only
makes it a German gloss. That it applied to a German
population by no means follows. No word is more German
than Welsh‚ few populations less so.

5. ln the name Rondinph the aare may, possibly, be the
Μ, in Haeo-Getam. Now the Erat-Geton were Lithu·
amans.

6. On the Nuithones I ean throw no light at all—not even
in the way of guesswork and suggestion.

If we leave Tacitus and betaka ourselves to Ptolemy, we
gain a little. In Ptolemy we not only get the names of
certain populations, but we get their locality (or at least
their direction) also. But they are almost all new, and other·
wise unknown, Sipaloreea Satiltayti, etati.

Upon the whole, I think that the Angli of Tacitus were the
only representatives, enumerated by him, of the AoyloSaxon
braneh of the Saxona-unless the Nuithones be a second.

Of the others, 1 think that :-

o. Where their direction was easterly, they were sla-
aenaeae.

b. Where it was northerly‚ Frisium, or Statoniens-
Frisians in the north-west, Slavonians in the north-eost.
