Who, however, lay to the east, and who to the north, is a
difficult question; and still more difficolt is it to say who
amougst the northern group, were on the east, and who on
the west.

The Siculone of Ptolemy are the most decidedly north·
western, or Frisian; the Varini of Tacitus, the most decidedly
eastern, or Slavonic. And thiais as much as it is sale to say.

It is more important to consider the reasons for believing
the populations to the north-west of the Asyli to have been
Frisios, rather than Angla, Saxon, or AngloSaxon. Why,
in the face of the fact of the Nordslhingians (or the popula·
