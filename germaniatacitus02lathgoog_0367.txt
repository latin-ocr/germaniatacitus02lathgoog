unaltared-we have only to account for its permancnce.
Assume, however, a change, and you have an additional
complication3 since you have to account for its transfer as
well.

The present existence, then, of the term Guddon==Go=
tlon—is an argument, usfar aa it goes, against any change

, of the original population; or, changing tha expression, the

supposed immigration of Lithnanians, and displaccment of
Germana, which hasbeen shown to be improbable in itself,
is rendered more so by the details that must be assumed if
we suppose that tha Guddon took their name from any Ger·
torres who were German.

ln order to make the cattini as Lithuanic as the Gallenos,
we must suppose one of two things, either that the former
were an outlying isolated sectiou cf the Lithuanic stock, or
that the interveuing arcas between the Gothini and Go
thonas were Lithuanic. Are there any reasons against the
latter view-reasons against assuming the coutinuity of s
Lithuanic population from the Carpathians to the Baltic
(and cicc carad), from the mere magnitude of the areat Nona.
The Lygian, which was parallel with it, is, in the same .
direction (from south to north), fully or nearly aa large.

From the present distribution of the Lithuanian dialects,
there are several ς but that these are not insuperablc, isshowu
in the Prosymna.

Ι do not, however, presa the point, since the approach of
the Gothini to the servile condition indicates the possibility
of their having been an outlying colony of captives.

All that I urge is the reference of the two (Gothini and
Gethones) to a common ethnological division (that division
being the Lithuanic), and the hypothesis which accounts for
the similarity of names.

l also urge the necessity of bringing the older Lithnanians
as far south as the parts just north of Gallicis, even if we
hesitate to continue them up tc the very country of the
Gothonca.

For clear and definite history,—and we must remcmber
that hIstory for these parts begins but little before the twelsth
century- bringsa Lithunnian population as fur in tlre direc-
