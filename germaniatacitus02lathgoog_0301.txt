and as long as that objectiou is met by the special statement that
their tongue was suevo, ic, in the eyes ol Tacitus, Oenunta

But there is a stronger objectiou. It will be seen iu the next
note that Ptolemy places them in the same category with the Lycii.

⁵Lp9iorum.]-Here, according tc l'acitus, we have a generis term
like Gallus aud Samo.

N either is there any reason to doubt his evidence On the con-
trary it is confirmed in more quarters thau oue.

l. Ptolemy gives the same generic power te the word—'tsi di roric

2. l'he extract from Nestor· confirma Ptolemy :-“ When the
Wallachiaus attached the Slovenians-the Slovenians went forth,
aud settled on the River Vislje (Vistula), aud called themselves
Lekhs (chcoooe). And some of these people were called Polcs, some
Luticai, some Pomoraniaus.”

This does something more thau confirm Ptolemy. It shows that
the root teet was Slavonic ts, the native name ογ which the
Slavonians of the Vistula called themselves, rather than the name
ογ which they were called by their noveSIavonic neighbours.

That the name os teet was recognised ογ other writers thau
Nestor, indeed, that it was a common designaticu, is shown ογ the
hypothesis ol the later chronicles, where it becomes the name of the
epcnymus of the Polcs. Tshehh and Lekh are the two leaders of
two great nations ; the first os the Poles, the second of the Bohe-
misna Of the latter, the present native uameis l'vloelcls,⁸ os tho
former, teet was the eripinal denominatiou.

Hence the name Μὴ in Nestor’s time, at least, was native.

After this, does any reader doubt the identity between the Lygii
of Tacitus aud the Pclesl or, admittiug this, does he believe ths
Lypii to have been Germani

Amongst ethuologists, hones, for one, insiste ou this latter view.

Iooufess that it strihes mo unfavourably that hc has kept back
the identity of locality‚ combined with the similarity of sound
between the Μὴ oi Nestor, aud the Lypie‘ cf Tacitus. Whether ve
look to his remarks cn the former word (p. 126), or the latter (p.

ὓ Prolegomena‚ p. xxiii.
