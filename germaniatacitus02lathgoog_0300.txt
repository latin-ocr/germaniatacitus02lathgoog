³ Osi.]-No other writer but Tacitus uooqoioooully mentions any
tribe with aname like that ot' Osi, in the neighbourhood of the
south-eastern March. 'l'he Oria‘ of Ptolemy are too far north to
coincide with them. 'Phese are a people beyond the Veltoe (otiien),
a Lithuanio nation on the Baloie-ntus δὲ τὴν μὲν ἑφεξῆς τῷ
Οὒενεδικᾷ κόλπῳ παρωκεανῖτιν κατὲχουσιν Ohs'hros, trip οὓς Ὅσιοι,
εἶτα Κάρέωνες α’ρκτικὼτατοις a people whose name Zeues is probably
right in eonnecting with that oi the island Osilio=0ezel.-P. 272.

Ι say that no writer but Tacitus ursoquiuooolly mentions any tribe
with a name like that of the Osi, in the'neigbbourbood oi the south-
eaetern Mareh3 and I now draw attention to the qualiiying word
unoquioooolly. What if the Obiotoripyror be the people'of otto·
toopy·‚ as they almost certainly were, and Otiotospy- be the bary or
berg os the osit

Whether the ·βουργ- in Obiotodpysos=berp=hilh or burgh:
bororsyb, te, whether the oompound be a word like Koningsberq, or
a word like Ham-bury, is os no great consequenoe. The word isa
German one. Yet it by no means follows that the nation it desig-
nated was German.

Wakbory (or Wisberql might be a German name ior a Slavonie
locality‚ just as Liesturrd (Liooniu) and Coorlond are.

It might also (as suggested in p. 97), in the hands of a Greek
writer, take the form Asciburgius Mons.

'Pbat the Osi were not German is Tacitus’s own statement.

The complement to this note is not. in rr. Arauisci oh Osis-Osi
oh Araviscis, p. 96, duc.

'Phe hypothesis is as follows :-

o. l'hst the population from inelaboratos Mores, or the Garpa·
thiens between Gallioia, Moravia, and Upper Hungery, was once
eontinuous with that of Groatia3 the northern portiones it being
ealled, by the Germane, Osi.

b. The invasion oi the Germane oi the Danube broke up this
eontinnity.

o. But not wholly. Witbiu the German area (probably in the
mountain strongholds of tbe Luna Susa=Jaolonka Berg), isolated
portienses the Osi preserved their language.

⁴ Burii.]-What applies to the Marsigni applies to the Booti.
'l'hey may be considered German as long as there ie no stronger
objection lying against them than their situation beyond the March,
