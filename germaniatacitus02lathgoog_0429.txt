cvi run cunum or ricinus.

The best evidence of their being emm is that of the
names of their leaders3 but such evidence would make the
Spaniards who fought under Wellc'nytou‚ Englishmen.

But what if we lind Voroe' on the Rhine, a comparatively
northern localityl The most that follows from this isa
doubt as to which of the two nearly synonymous populations

pppy wore—Aocrewi of the Vistula, or Varini of the Lower
be.

What if we find them in connection with the Anyti? This
helps us in the deciduo, and inclines us to prefer the Vos-iaie
but it by no means proves connection.

But what if they be Αορῖαο in Thuringial This, again,
only makes us pause in deciding which Ανιρῖσι are meant.
lt never touches the connection.

What if we find thern in eontact with the Dauesl This
denotas that the particular Vae thus described were Varini.

But what if Daet=Daet?* This throws us back on the
Acar-oni. ι

Nothing, however, touches the connection. It is only the
details that are complicated: details which are just as diffi-
cult, whether we suppose a migration or uot.

All this really happens, as may be seen by comparing the
following extract with the ἠνιίσρουιοτιο, §§ xnr. and xuu. :—
Οὔορνοι μὲν ὑπὲρ Ἴστρον ποταμὸν ἵδρυνται, διήκουσι δὲ
ἄχρι τε ἐς Ὠκεανὸν τὸν ἀρκτῷον καὶ ποταμὸν Ῥῆνον, ὅσπερ
adsedere διορίζει καὶ Φρόνγιγους καὶ τᾶλλα ἔθνη, δταύτῃ
ἵδρυνται. Οὗτοι ἅπαντες, ὅσοι τὸ παλαιὸν ἀμφὶ Ῥῆνον
ἑκατέρωθεν ποταμὸν ᾤκηντο, ἰδίου μέν τινος ὀνόματος ἕκαστοι
μετελάνγχανον . . . ἐπὶ κοινῆς de Γερμανοὶ ἐκαλοῦντο ἅπαντες
. . Οὔαρνοι δὲ καὶ Φράνγγοι τουτὶ μόνον τοῦ Ῥήνου τὸ ὕδωρ

μεταξὺ ἔχουσιν.-Ρτοοορ. Bell. Goth. iv. 20.

Again, Ἐρουλοι . . ἔρημον δὲ χώραν διαδόντες ἐνθένδε

πολλὴν ἐς τοὺς Οὖάρνους καλουμένους ἐχώρησαν. Μεθ’ olle

δὴ καὶ Δονῶν τὰ ἔθνη παρέδραμον.-Ρτοοορ.ΒοΠ. Goth, ii. 15.

Lastly, Procopius relatos that an Anyto princeos was be-
trothed to Radigon the prinee of the Varus-The Saxone
in England‚ i. 23.
