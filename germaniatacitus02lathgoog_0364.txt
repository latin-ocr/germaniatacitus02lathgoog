words, I believe the nemeto be cetico iu one of the two cases
only3 so that the Goth-ici were Gt only in tha eyes of
their Slavonic neighbours, just asa Peloponnesian wasa Greek
in the eyes of aRoman only; whereas the Gottoocs (Gallenos,
bre.) were Ge in the eyes of their Slavonic neighbours and
themselves as well, even aethe spatiarer of Epirus was doubly
Greek3 Greek when he spoke of himself, and Greek when
he was spoken of by a Roman.

The reason for drawing this distinction is as follows :-

α. There is uo evidence of the numerous Lithuauic popula·
tions ever having had a collective er general name of their
own, however mnch they may have had one given them by their
Slavonic neighbours3 in both of these respects being exactly
iu the same ease as the mmm.

b. For the rpeoifie name of a particular Lithnanian popula·
tion (ia, for a name equivalent to otoni, chmel, of similar
divisione of the Garamas), the term Gethones (Gothini, Gut-
tones, dvc), if extended from Gallicia to (lourland, is of im-
probable (I do not say impossible), extent. No single rectiore
of a population is likely to have had so large an area.

c. The difference between the name of the people (cortici),
and their language (Gallico), suggests the likelihood of the
catice of the cortine· having been some form of eal
(Hal, dvc). Iu England, in the sixteenth and seventeeuth
scutarios, the generality of writers spoke of the people of
Germany ae Gormocs5 but of the leoyaoyo, as Dutch, High
Dutch, or Low Dutch, as the case might he. Hence, we heard
of traoshrtioca from tle High Dutch, even though the people
who spoke it were called Germans.

Now I consider that the same Slavonians who spoke of
the people of Gallicis as Gothiae· (a presumed Slavonic form),
were also those who spoke of their langnage as Gallio (a pre·
sumed native form); even cs oue and the same population (the
English) spoke of the Dutch tongue aud the German people.

And Ι also consider that those same Slavonians called the
language of the Gothini Gallio, because Gallie was the
cetico name of it 3 just aethe fact of Dutch heiug the native
name of the German, accounts for the terms High Dutch and
Low Dutch.
