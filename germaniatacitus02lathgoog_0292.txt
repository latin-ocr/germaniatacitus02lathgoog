An additional reason lor beliewing that, in the eyes os a Gomon,
the source of ibe Scala was the source of the Elbo, is ιο be found in
the name ol the latter river itseli uhe name Elo=rioer,· the
Soandinavian equivalenb ιο the German mon-a fact which shows
’ either that the Frisian of the Lower Elbe was spoken in a form
approaching the N oros, or else that the N orse ilsell was then spoken
farther southwards than afterwards-“Albo fluvius oritur in prm·
dictis Alpibus, perque medios Gothorum populos currit in Oceanum,
inde οι Gothelba dicitnr.''-De Sit. Dsniae, c. 229. This applies to
the Swedisb river Goludfi

Now as the name was German, and as it was given by the popu·
lation of the lower peri of the river, it is more likely that it was
extended upwards ιο a Gannico branch, like the Saale, than ιο a
Slaoonic one, like that which risos in Bohemia

Aa Tacitus is now beginning with the Danube, up ιο which he
brings the Hermunduri, the source of the Illbe must be in the more
northern parisos the arsa ol that population 3 but as he deo sepa-
rates the Hermunduri from the Saevi, we must be carelul agaimo
carrying the frontier ιοο far in that directior.
