It might 1111111111 as old 11 111 name AE'stii. “ 111 der Name Prusi
11 alt, als der Nemo disten, wenn er auch mehr uls 111 Jahrtauseud
opiter austritt.”-Ibid.

Gaudentius's form is not Prosci but Protesi. .

Dietmer's form is also not Protesi hut Prosci.

Adam’s of Bremen is also not Pistori but Protesi and Prostsoe'.

'l'his shows that the sound was that. of 11, 111111, or, possibly, even
1111111 rather thau of asimple -1 ,· amatter of some 1111111111, as it
helpe to account for the 1 required 11 make the root Prius· like the
root Brit.

Now comes the important fact that we iind the word taking an
adjectiwal form in -11, 11 which 1111111111111111111 ’1111111111-
tiwal forins are Preizei, Proust, Proiecto, Peucetio, Preasci, Pretorio ;
but the adjectival ones 111Ρ111111111, Plisthenio, Pruthewicue. We
are now getting near 111 form Britannicum ,· aud it must be remem-
bered that the form thus similar, is 111 form almost always used
when tho language is spoken of-lingua Penuhenica not Praesta.

The root 11111 undergoes a similar series of transformation-
1111111, Bossia, 1111111111, 1111111111.

Lastly, the form Borotssi 11111111111111 B.

All this, however, it may be said, applies 11 the Latin lengnage,
aud is, consequently, out 11 place ; the question being whether
Slueonioo forms 11 the root Prae can become sufficiently like an
1111111111 modification of the root 8111- to create confusion. l'hey
can. 'Phe Slawonie word which a German would translate by
Brittehe, and a Roman hy Britannico, would be Britekaja, and the
similar 1111111111 11 Proetiae and Pmdlewico Prut-skajc.

'l'his gives us then the AEstii and Gethones (11 rather the AEstii
or Gethones) as the representatives of theold Prussians or Lithu·

aniau Sarmaticus of the Baltic.
In the twelsth, thirteenth, and sonrteenth oentnries, when infor·
