Like Tacitus, Dion makes no mention of the Chatta-arii.
Strabo does; his form being Χαττουάριοι.
So does Velleius Paterculus3 his form being Atta-arii.

Ptolemy’s Χαιτούωροι introduce a complicatiou which will
be notieed in the sequel. ’

The locality of the Chattuarii of Strabo aud Paterculus
was the watershed of the Ruhr and Lippe. Strabo mentions
them in conjunction with the Gambrivii, aad Patercnlus with
the Bructeri—“ Intrate protinus Germania, subacti Gauine·
lates, Attuarii, Bructeri, recepti Cherusci.”·-ii. 105.

They increase in historica] prominence as we advauce3 and
in the reign of Julian, Ammianus writes “ Rheno exinde

transmisso regionem subito pervasit Francorum quos Aao-
arioe vocent.'' - xx. 10.

Between the eighth and eleventh centuries the nemeis
common, and numerous documeuts speek of the tarra, paguo
and comitaturus the Chataara'i, Hadriati, Haaroariiff Atu-
arii, Hattera,† aud Hatera, and numerous places are meu·
tioned ae lying within it. ι

All these lay on the western side of the enine, aa, on

the Niers, a feeder of the Meas3 so that the minute ethno-
logist may divide the Attuarii of the middle-age writers into
the eastern eud western hrauches.

“ ln nn. 715 Sarranae vastaverunt terram alacastona?
-Anual S. Amand. Perta. i. 6.

But the most interesting fact connected with the chatt-
aarii is the occurrence of their native name Hert-ware in the
Traveller's Song, and Beowulf.

The king, whose sou, the hero of the great Angle epia,
Beowulf, succeeded, bore a name the form of which was—

ln aa, Hipalaa—

ln laelandie, Haghikr-

lu Latin, Cloelihrielw
being, variously called, a Daue, aGeat, and au Angle.

His desceut upon one of the papi of King Theodorie is thus
mentioned by Gregory of Tours :—“ llis ita gestis Dani cum
rege suo, nomine Ohochileicho, evectu navali per mere

ἢ Α near approach to the form Chasuarii.
† Compare this with Bructeri, as opposed to Borucluarii.
