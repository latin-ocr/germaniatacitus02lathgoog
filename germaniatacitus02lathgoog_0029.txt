this tho case in ethnologyr No. The Russian language‚
although northern in locality, is southern in structure, being
more ahin to the Servian, with which it is notin contaet,
than the Polish with which it ia. Nay, more, the older
the specimens of the langnage the more it approaches the
Old Ohurch-langnage, or the Old Slavonic.

This is by no means an irrelevant question even in German
ethnology. For that of southern Europe aud Asia it is all·
important.

The greater the area we give to the Germane of Tacitus,
the less room we leave for the numerous Sarmatian popula-
tions now in existence; and the less room we leave for these,
the greater the difficulty of aocounting for their wide diffusion.

By suppming, however, that they originated in eo large
a country as Russia we meet this difficulty, since we thereby
allow ourselvee a vast tract of land to draw upon for the
several migratione necessary to account for the present
presence of Polea in' Poland Serbs iu Silesia, Tshelrs in
Bohemia, Slovake in Hungary‚ and Oariothians, Oroatiana
and Delmaticae, elsewhere.

But what if the intercal evidence derived from the paucity
of Russian dialecto, or (changing the expression) the uni·
formity of that tongne over a vast area indicate—ae such
phenomena do iudicate-a recent introduction and a rapid
diffusioni Io this case, the difficulty remeius as before,
and we must not only exclude a great number of Slavonians
from the countries ot' the west, but from the valley of the
Dnieper aleo.

Now, from all thatI collect from the language of the
hest Slavonic scholare, the Russian tongue in Ruseia seems
full as newas the Augu-Saron is in England; in other words,
its dielects are fewer and lese marked than those of the
English of Great Britain.

On the other hand, it is in the south aud weet that such
differences are the most marked and the most numerous.
