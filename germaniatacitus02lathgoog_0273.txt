consideratione of this kind justiiy ue in believing that, when oer-
tain great natione are spoken of as aetinga conspicuous part in
history, certain minor ones may be included in the general name.

Hence, l believe that when the Cherusci are spoken of in general
history, the Chamavi and Angrivarii are included! in one of the two
denominations; and the words are used in apolt'ticcl sense. The
etleuoloyt'oal, and narrower sense of the words, occurs only when the
details os the geography or history require separation and speci-
fication.

The country of the Proper Cheruscane was bounded on the vvest
by the deprimit,- for I suppose anern, near Herford-the
traditionary battle-field of the Arminian victory-to represent that
name.

ho the south-west of the Angrivarii lay the Chamavi-Hamm
being, again, supposed to retain their designation.

On the north-east we may probably carry the Proper Cheruscans
ae far as the Harta. For this, however, see Ept'leyomenc, §Har-adea.

It ie nov time to inquire whether the Cherusci and their allisa
represented en ethnological section of the Germanic populations ae
they, certainly, did a politioal one. The answer to this is in the
affirmative. Without committing ourselves to the doctrine that the
Cheruscan lesgue madly ooinoided trith the Cheruscan form of the
German language, ve may safely say that such was nearly the case.
If so, the Cherusci are of the same ethnologieal importando vith the

of the Socors division oi the German dialects as opposed to the
PlattDeutsch and High German, and of the Saron nationalities as
opposed to the Frank, Alemannic, and Gothic, Lombard and Bur-
gondian, the Cherusci are the southern representatives.

of the Cherusci, in the vide sense os the term, the north and

“ north-western members appear in the eighth century under the

name of Old Saxone, this meaning the Saxone of the continent, or
the mother-country, in opposition to the Saxone oi llngland, or
anglo-Saxona

If the Cherusci oi Tacitus and the earlier wdters bs the Saxone of
Beda and later ones, hosv comes it that the one name never appears
in the classical, and the other never in the German writeret Cum,
