But is this the only analysis of the two words—Bauthaib

and Wnrcondaibl I think not. The commoneat of all the

terminatione ol the towns ol Dacia was dana-Rusidava, bre,
as may be seen by going no further than Arrowemith's map.

siguin, Buatuidis admitted by Zeuss to mean the -ratt (or
-uill of the Slavonic Antea* As lor the root Wurooad, it
is, at least, aa likely to represent the Umyuad· in Untgeodi,
as the Burg in the true Bargrwrdiuna.

To all this must be added the remarks in the note in
v. Longodcrdi suggesting that from the fact of the term
being an epithet rather than a separate substantive name,
there isa likelihood of there having been more amputares
than one, and that independent of ethuological affinity. ¹

Upon the whole, although the evidence of the Lombards
having originally been Goths or Germane, and the evidence of
their having effected a migration from north to south, are
not wholly unexceptionable‚ less objections lie against them
than against any other similar instance: and I only con·
sider it doubtful when it is made the basis of any ulterior
deductione—such as that of making some very doubtful Ger-
mane Germnn, because they stood in certain relations to the
Lombards of Lombardy.

Perhaps the structure of the Lombard armamenta may
have been like that of the vandala—German in respect to
its chiesa, Slavonic in respect to the bnlk of the forces3 in
which case the Langobardi may have been the analogues of the
Astiagir in which case, too, they may have represented the
Langobardi of Tacitus. The distant migration of a cognu-
tio or silscecfl secking war, is more likely than the distant

under a higher politica} or administrative unity, different only in degree,
und not in kind from what prevuiled individuully in each.

“The kingdom is only a lurger Ga than ordinary, indeed the na itsell
was the original kingdom. But the unsevered possession or property
which we thus find in the na is by no means to be considered in the
same light as that which hasbeen described in the Mark. The inhabitants
ure settled as Machmas, not ns Gtmcn ; the cultivated land which lies
within thc limit ot the larger community is all distributed into smaller
ones.'’—Suxons iu Englund, vol. i. 7³.
