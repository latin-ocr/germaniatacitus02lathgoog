media and Heraclea ; during the time ol the Persian dominice they
were governed by native princes, and aller the dissolution of the
Persian aud Macedonian empires, the latter os which had always

been least consolidated in Asia Minor, they extended themselves,
and acquir-ed considerable importance Nicomedes, then king, took
tlrose Gauu'intc his pay, there being then only ten thousand armed
meu among them, defeated his rival, and founded the Bithynian

nate, which gradually becarm Hellenised. From that time, the
Gauls sold their services ιο any one who might seelr thern, and made
the whole ol western Asia tributary ιο themselves. Their history is
yet in grem conhrsiun 3 but it can be cleared up, many materiale
existing for it. l'hey were defeaoed by Antiochus Soter, whereupon
they withdraw into the mountains, whence they atterwards burst
forth wlrenever circumstances allowed them, and all the neighbour-
ing nations paid tribute, to escape their devastatione. But when
the war between Ptolemy Euergetes and Seleucus Callinicus, and
atterwards that between the former· aud Antiochus Hierax broke
out, they showed themselves thoroughly suithless, selling themselves

idlcness they had become quite effeminate and unwarlilre, like the
Goths whom Belisarius found in Italy. 'l'hey never entirely re·
covered from this blow, though they still continued ιο exercise
considerable influence, for Asia was always divided ; and although
Antiochus was staying in those countries, he was too much occupied
toturn his attention to them, aud would not, rumcoven, have been
able ιο protect that part ol Phrygia bordaring on the district inha-
biud hythe Gaulo. Hence they still levied tribute iar and wide,
aud alter the fall oi Antiochus, the Asiatic nations dreaded lest they
should be unable to defend themselves, This gave On. Manlius an
opportunity ol undertaking a campaign against thern, and to corne
forward aa the protector ol the Asiatica against the Galaticae His
demand that they should submit had been answered by those bar-
barians with a stolida ferocis, and he accordingly marohed through
Phrygia, and attached thern in their mountains, without, however,
extirpating them. They continued in those districts, and preserved
their Celtic language for a remarkably long period. We find it
