In deayiap the name Gt to be native to the Goth-iai,

¹ ι lassume that there is no special evidence in favour of its

being s0; and such I believe to be the case.

ln offirminp the same name to he native to the Gelli-eoas,
I am prepared with evidence.

Is the name which in Tacitus takes the form Gallim
native or foreign? known to the tribes to which it applies, or
as strange to them as the term Welsl is to Gambrianl This
is not answered in the reasoning upon the word AEstic‘ ,-
since it by no means follows that because one out of two
names given to a country is undoubtedly foreign, the other
is necessarily indigenous. The fact of the term Geticum
being indigenous is not a legitimate inference from the exotic
character of the name AEstc'i. Just as the latter designation
was German, the former may have been Slavonic; and the
one may have been as unhke the real native name as the
other.

Praetorius, a Pole, writing mn. 1688, in his Orbis Gothicus,
devotes two sections to the following questions :—

“An reliquia nominis Gothici in terris Europeae Sarmatiae
reperiantur?

“ Unde nominis Gadda contemptus hodie in Prussia 3⁹⁸

From these we leam that the Samogitians, Russians,
Lithuanians, Prnssians, Zalavonians, Nadravians, Natravians,
Sudoviaus, Mazovians, and the inhabitants of Ducal Prussia
were called Guooorrs by the people about Koningsberg, and
that this name was a acme os contempt, accounted for by the
extent to which the populations to which it applied, had
retained their paganism against the efforts of the propagatore
of the Pmssian Christianity. “ Gaddarum infidelium nomeu
existit, adeo ut Gothus sive Gelidus idem iis qni paganus et
ethnicus, hostisque Christianitatis audierit.''*

That it was also Slavonic isshown by a line from an old
Tshelrh (Bohemian) poem.

Gotstgy'o lrrasnyje diewy na brecje sinemu morju.
Gon-ist seir maidens on banlr of (the) bine see.

In order to appreciate the full import of the previous state·
