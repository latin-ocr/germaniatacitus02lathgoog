Ptolemy's notice oi the populations whose name end iu -bard
(and in Ptolemy there are two suoh) introduces a difficulty.

He first places Langobardi (hayyota'pdos) west and south oi the
ΐίιίιέἑῖηῃῗίονί (mssa οἱ ’appronat these latter being on the

Alterwards he plaoes hassotdpdos between the (lhauoi Majores
and the Suewi3 conterminans with the Angrivarii and Dulgubini
(onhyov‘ptvsot).

'l'his complication may, possibly, appear unimportant ς so that
the inquiror may, perhaps, think himself justified in disposing os it
at onoe by assuming either an error in the reading, or an oversight
in the author. Possibly, this view is right. Nevertheless, itis by no
means neeessarily so. ule word in question is aaompound of whioh
the qualifying element comes first. Henoe, it is far from impossible
that whilst Langobardi means men aiat barda (beardo or taltorta, as
tho oass may be) oi one sort, Lakhobardi may mean men saith bardo
(beardo, dae.) ol another. 'l'ruo it is that tho elementa Laop· and
Latio-are suspiciously alike ; neither ean any satisfactory meaning be
giren to the latter word. Nevertheloss, tho inferente of their being
the same word is far from oonelusive. Compound words may be
aliks and yet different 3 as are Wessea and Essem

Zeuss gives a lull, perhaps an excessivo, import to this differenoe,
considering that the Latkobards' were not only the subsequent oon-
querors of Italy ander Alboin (which the Langobardi were not)
but that Ptolemy knowingly and intentionally distinguished between
the two-“ Dieso Σουῆέοι konnen also nicht mit den Langobarden,

soheint os, will sie untersohieden wissen, dass er disse, die achon in
getrennten Sitzeu aulgestellt sind, obwohl ihr name demslbe ist,

hgain-“Mit den Σουῆέοι Λαγγοέάρδοι des Ptolemaeus dhrfen
nicht worweohselt werden seina hassota'pdos, bo.”—p. 109.

It is doubtful, however, whether Ptolemy’s own text requiras this
distinction to bo thus stringently insisted on, ta, if we take the
Anasi-varis· to bo the oentre for our inquiries, and admit Etsyena to
represent their loeality.-See 5 xxxiii.

Thus-a. The Ssavi Langobardi are nonterminous with tha
