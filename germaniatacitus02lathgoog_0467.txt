Such the difficulties attending the doctrine of an original
mminaity os oreo ond enlwqacut dirploeemeat.

The other alternative, or that of simple migration‚ requires
three facts to he horne in mind—

ο. That it ie no further from the Dardanellcs ιο the ludus
than from the Indus to the Dardanelles.

d. That the real conquesta of Alexander (especially that
which led ιο the establishment of the Greek kingdom of
Bactria) differed from such a European conquest as ie ueces-
eary ιο account for all the phenomeua of the Sanshrit and
allied lauguages in date, magnitude, and duration only-ie,
in degree though not in kind.

e. That the Majier conquest of Hungary differe only iu
date; for, certainly, it would be a bold statement to assert
that a similar conquest of an area of equal magnitude on the
Indus, on the part of the Europeans of Thrace and the
Lower Danube, at a sufficieutly early date, would not account
for all the points of likeness between the Hindn aud the
European. The likelihood of such an event happening‚ie
measured by the actual conquesta of the Macedoniaus.

Such is the balance of the difficulties of the two hypothecam
the conclusion in the mind of the present writer being that if
we consider the Sanskrit to be Asiane, in the way thet the
Majier is Europam, we escape the annecessary multiplicatiora
of causes, and avoid assumptione of which the number aud
amount hae never been fairly measured.

How far the lon of India are Get-n, is a difficolt question.

The magnitude of the area in which the coincidence occurs
is quite large enough to allow us ιο consider it occidental.
Still, a case may be made ont the other way.

ᾗ nxvlu. ΟΝ THE abael-nennium GAULS·

By Queri-Germanic l mean those Gauls who, by some
writer or other of antiqnity‚ have been considered to either be
German or ιο exhibit German characteristica.

They are chiefly noticed in Tacitus, in §xxviii.‚ being the
Treviri, Neruii, Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetae.
