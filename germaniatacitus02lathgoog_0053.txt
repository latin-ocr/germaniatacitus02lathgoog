their way of denoting it was less precise than our own, and
not always expressed in the same terms.

Of the Ugrians they knew little. Nevertheless, Tacitus
aud others distinguish between the Finns aud the Genuans.

The Albaniana, I think, were distinguished from the Greeks
clearly,· but from thanations on their northern frontier iu-
distiuotly. The term Illyrius comprises the Albaniam, med
aasabim moro.

The Iberians were clearly distinguished from all other
stocks but the Keltic-from that indistinctly.

Upon the whole, the ancients may be said to have over-
valued the difference between themselves and the other six
stocks, and to have medervalued the differeuce between the
other groups of Europe ς and this is just what the Spaniards
aud English did and do with the present American abori-
grues.

These observatione have been made upon the assumption
that the only point which required illustration was the extent
to which the ancients and moderna differed in their views of
the samo pheresaeum an assumption which supposes that the
number of stochs at the beginning of the historioal period was
neither more nor less than it isat present, and that their
mutual relations were the same. This, however, may not
have been the cass. Stoohs may hare become extinct; or,
instead of the broad and trenohaut lines of demarcation which
now separate the grem groups from each other, there may
have been a series of imperceptible transitione. In either of

· these cases it would be incorrect to say that the modern view
is more scientific than the ancient, The latter, instead of

seeing the same things ina different light, may have seen a
different state of things.
