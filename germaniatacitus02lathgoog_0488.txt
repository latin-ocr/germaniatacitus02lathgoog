Of Appian the whole evidence goes one way, oia, that the
tribes in question were Cauls. His expressions are: πλεῖ· ,
σταν τε καὶ μαχιμώτατον-χρῆμα Κελτῶν εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν

καὶ τὴν Γαλατίαν civitate—iv. 2. In bis book on illyria
be etates, that the Kelts and Cimbri, along with the lllyrian
tribe ot' the Autariata, bad, previous to the battle against
Marius, attached Delphi and suffered sor their impiety.

Quintilian may be considered to give us upon the subject
tbe notions of two writers-Virgil, and either Caesar or
Crassus. In dealing, however, with the words of Quintilian,
it will be seen that there are two assumptione. That either
Caesar or Crassus considered the Cimbri to be Gaula, we infer
from the following passage: ‘⁴ Rerum est autem, ut oculis
subjicere contingat (sc. vituperationem), ut fecit C. Julius, qni
cum Helvio Manciae saepius obstrepenti sibi diceret, jam osterr-
dum, qualis etr: isque plane instaret interrogatione, qualem
se tandem ostensurus esset, digito demonstravit imaginem
Galli in scuto Mariano Cimbrico pictam, cui Mancia tum
simillimus est visus. Tabernae antem erant circum Forum, ao
scutum illud signi gratia positum.”—Inst. Orat. vi. 3, 38.
Pliny tells the story of Crassus (xxxix. 4). Although in this
passage the word upon which the argument turus has been
written palti, and translated cock, the current interpretationis
the one giren above-Vid. not. ed. Gesner.

in the same author is preserved the epigram of Virgil's
called Catalecta, and commented on by Ausonius of Bordeaux.
Here we learn that Τ. Annius Cimber was a Gaul; whilst it
is assumed that there was no otber reason to believe that he
was called Cimber than that of his being descended from
some slave or freedman of that nation:-“ Non appareat
affectatio, in quam mirilice Virgilius,

Corinthiorum amator iste verborum

llle iste rhetor: nomque quatenus totus
Thucydides Britannus, Attica febres,
Tau-Gallicum, min, al· spina male illisit.
lta omnis istu verbe miscuit fratri.

Cimber hie luit a quo fratrem necatum hoc Ciceronis dictum
