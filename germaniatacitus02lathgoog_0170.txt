army-Here the reading is doubtful, lemae being
another form.

The existence oi eu heroic (or semi-heroic) family- called nidinga,
gives us the nearest approach to the illustration for the former; the
root Ast, in Ascipargium, for the latter. See not. ud a.

It may sefely be said that the carmina antiquo that explain any

N otwithstanding the words o scepsis incedo nomine, Ι believe that
the word Gemmas was as foreign to the ancient Germane, as the
word Welrt isto a (lambro-Britou. the nativos of the principality,
as is well known, call themselves oamratq. vett, is what they
ars called by their neighbours.

From 'l'acitns's own evidence, the name is new. This, which is ⁰

primii socie evidence of its not being native, is conclusive as to the
fact of their having originally had no collective designation.

vhe particular portion of the Germanic population which crossed
the Rhine, had two names-Tungri and mosi. Tacitus ex·

old, the other recent. Iknow no instance of such a change The
real fact seems to have been that Tungri was the mbos, aecem
the Gauio name for one and tbe same people,-just like Welat and
Commag, Englistmccs and Summi.

l'he extension of the designation of a particular tribe, family, or
nation, toa whole stock, is well illustrated by the word Groecio.
