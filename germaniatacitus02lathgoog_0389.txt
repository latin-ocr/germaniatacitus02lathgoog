Zeuss compares this with the Norae rtis=dpdpor=rcoo
(the same word).

Against it are—

a. The utter absence of any such name applied ιο any
portion of the Norsemen, in any of the numerous Norae
writings.

d. Its present power, as the name of so large a country as
Russia, withso few definite traces of Norse occupancy.

o. The name Rtocoheai, of a nation between the Don and
Dnieper.

The following view is considered ιο reconcila these diffi-
cultiea.

Provious to the descent on the Euxine and (inspico, the
Norsemen conquered and occupied the country of the Bloc-
lcaee, and, after they had become known ιο their neighbours
as des, harasscd the eastern empire.

In being known ιο their neighbonre bytho name of the
country they occupied, they were like the present Spaniards
of Mexico. ·

The question aa to the stock to which those Rheolm
belonged, will bring with it a fact confirmatory cf the pre·
vicus view. Although we nowhere find that the Norsenren
in question tiewwelooe called tdenwdoes Ros, the Finlanders at
the present moment call them Raeto-alainen, and their country

Bu'lo'iiid is a fact which has long been known. It bas also

long been known that doloso is the regular Finlandic ter-
mination for gentile noune. Such being the case, the word
Ῥωξολονοί has long been looked on as a genuine Hyr-ica
gloss; and as Strabo mentions the Rhooolcoi, there must
Ι have been, in his time, not only Ugrians in Russia, but
Ugrians so near the Euxine aa for words of their tongue ιο
reach his informante.

Such Ι believe ιο bava been the ease. I think that there
were Ungans as far south as the Lcwer Danube. This con-
firma the aetion thet Russia was not originally Slavonic!
It also confirma the notion that there were Ugrians in South
Europe before the Majiar invasion.
