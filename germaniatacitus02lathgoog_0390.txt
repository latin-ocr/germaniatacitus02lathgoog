Strabo's notice of the Bhouohmi is as follows :-‘H δ’
ὑπερκειμένη πᾶσα χώρα τοῦ λεχθέντος μεταξὺ Βορυσθένους
καὶ Ἴστρου, πρώτη μέν ε’στιν ἡτῶν Γετῶν ἐρημία· ἔπειτα
οἱ Τυριγέται· μεθ’ οὓς οἱ Ἰάζυγες Σαρμάται, καί οἱ Βασίλειοι
λεγόμενοι, καί Οῧργοι, τὸ μὲν πλέον νομάδες, ὀλίγοι δὲ καί
γεωργίας ἐπιμελούμενοι· τούτους φασί καί παρὰ τὸν Ἴστρον

οἰκεῖν, ἐφ’ ἑκάτερα πολλάκις. Ῥωξολανοὶ δ’ ἀρκτικώπαποι
τὰ μεταξὺ τοῦ Τανάιδος καὶ τοῦ Βορυσθένους νεμόμενοι
πεδία. Ἡ γὰρ προσάρκτιος πᾶσα ἀπὸ Γερμανίας μέχρι τῆς
Κασπίας πεδιάς ἐστιν, ἣν ἴσμεν ὑπὲρ δὲ τῶν Ῥωξολανῶν εί
τινες οἰκοῦσιν, οὐκ iopen—Strabo, vii. p. 306.

From this it follows thet modern Ituaaio has taken ita
neme, not-

α. From any dominant Norae conquerors, so·culled; but-

ὀ. From a portion ol its area called Ιιυοιιι, originally occu-
pied by Ugrian Ituoteolcoe, but usterwards by Norsemen
(chiefly Swedes), to whom the neighbonring natione extended
the name of the territory.

In other words, the Northmen of Bootsi were called Ilua,
even as en Angle of Britannia might be called Britannus.

The Ῥὣς were connected with the Vorauyi, but, as the
Varcapi were connected with the Franks in name only, the
two previous sections heve been, ιο a certain extent, epi-
sodicel.

Ι. Ττυο occupante of Frank locatitias, and probably true
membere ose Frank confederecy ere the Chattuarii.

This is no Low German form of the word Chae-uurii3
although, et the first view, it seems such3 since the single ι
has a less tendency ιο become t then the double one; or
(changing the expression), the High German ι most usually
becomes t in Low German when the vowel thet precedes itis
short. Now, the α in Chasuarii is long; since it represents
the α in nume of the river Ηοιι. Hence, Chasuarii and
Ohott-uarii are oct in the seme relation to each otherus

Hasce is to Chatti. 2
