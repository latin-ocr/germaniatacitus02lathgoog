ol classes. We may even admit the consideration of certain
externa] circumstances, such as literary development, and
political separation. This makes the arrangement more or
less artificial.

Be this, however, as it may, the following is a classi·
fication uf the kind in question.

α. The Danish, vaedish, and Norwogian dialects (written
and nnwritten), the Faroic and the laelandic, form the
Soandinavian branch of the Gothic stock.

h. The Frisiau, Old-Saron, anglo-saxon, English, Low·
land Scotch, Dutch of Holland, Platt-Dentsch, and High
German, form the Teutonis hranch of the same.

Of course these again fall into subdivisione, according to
the date of the specimen, ay, there is the Old Frisiau,
Middle Frisiau, aud Now Frisian3 Semi-Saron, Old English,
Middle English, and Modern English3 the Moeso-Gothic,
Alamannia, &c

The disadvantage of this method is that, in attempting
to draw definite lines of demarcatiou between the different
divisione, it disturbs the history of the languages, and dis·
guises the order of their evolution. Thus the Frisian, a
member nithe Teutonio branoh, is undoubtedly nrore lilre
certain Scandinavian dialects than it is to the more extreme
members of its own division.

Such being the case, afrosh view is required, and this is
hest given by placing the tongues in a linear series according
to their affinities, and treating them as if (as is really the
case) they passed into each other by insensible degrees.

Hence, the more convenient, as well as the more natural
series, is that of the first chapter, oie.

' l. Norse. 2. Frisian. 3. Old Saxon. 4. Anglo-Saxon.

5, 6. Platt·Dentsch and the Dutch of Holland. 7. High
German. 8. Moeso-Gothic.

The general characteristica of these divisions and subdivi-
sious of the Gothic tongues, in respect to the differenees of
their systema ot' elementary soumis, their grammatical struo-
ture, and their vocabularies, are in the department of philology.
One or two isoleted points, however, have a practioal bearing
upon certain sthnologieal details.
