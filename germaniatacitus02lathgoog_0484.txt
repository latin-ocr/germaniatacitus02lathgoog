whitst the word Dent-sel means German. As the Tenet-ones
were Germane, sowere the Oimbri also. Now this line of
argument is set aeide by the circumstance that the syllable
Teat- in Tenet-ones and Petet-eniens, as ,the names of the con-
federates of the Cimbri, is wholly unconnccted with the Tent-
in theod-iaces, and Dent-sel. This is fully shown by Grimm
in his dissertation on the words German and Dutch. ln its
oldest form the latter word meant popular, natione& oerne-
enlar‚· it wesen adjective applied to the cebet· teneone, or the
vernacular German, in opposition to the Latin. In the tenth
century the secondary form Tenet-eniens came in regne even
with German writers. Whether this arose out of imitation of
the Latin form Iteneene‘ca or out of the idea of an historical

⁸ connection with the Teutones of the classice, is immaterial.

It is clear that the present word Dent-sele proves nothing
respecting the Teutones. Perhaps, however, as early as the

, time of Martial the word Teutonicas was used in a general

sense, denoting the Germans in general. Certain it iethet,
before his time, it meant the particular people conquered by
Marius, irrespective of origin or locality.-See Grimm's

Vell. Patererelas.-The testimony ol this writer as to the
affinities of the natione in question is involved in his testimony
as to their locality‚ and consequently subject to the same cri-

Strabo—Oret and above the references already made,
Strabo has certain specilic statements concerning the cimbri:
a.) That according to a tradition (which he does not believe)

, they left their country on account of an inundation of tlte sea.
