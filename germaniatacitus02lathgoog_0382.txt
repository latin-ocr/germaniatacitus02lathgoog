Froaeooia‚'we may simply suppose them to he Franks of
a different division of the Frank name.

All that follows from the proposed latitude given to the
name Moroomumri, follows from the proposed latitudo given
to the name Frank.

Indeed‚ if we look at their geographicel distribution, we
shall lind that the Franks were the Moralem of the Roman*
frontier; and I submit ῖο the reader the doctrine, that
they called themselves Franks because they were so, sla, in
opposition to their senos-Germane, who were subject ῖο
Rome.

A German of the Decumates agri was Ποῖ a Frank (though
he might he an Alemone), because he was not really free.

Tho Burgundian of the interior country was not a Frank.
Really free h'e was; but as his freedom was Ποῖ contrasted
with the dependenoe of his neighbours‚ it was not necessary
for him to eall himself so.

What is gained hy the hypothesis? To say nothing about
the minor migratione, it geta over (amongst others) the fol-
lowing great difficulty.

The Franks of Franoouia are Hipt· those of the Lower
Rome, Low Germana

Such the hypothesis.

l. Pto Franks os the southern srootier —Probus had to deal
with both Alemanni aud Franks. Ιῖ reprobabis that these
were the Franks of Franeonia.

The Franks whom Aurelian chastised were certainly so;
and, upon the whole, I think it is these Franeonian Franks
(the Franks of the Upper Rhine) who appear earliest
in history. Even if they do Ποῖ, they appear far too soon
to have the name aooounted for by any conquesta or migra·
tions; movemeuts either way, from the Upper to the Lower‚
or from the Lower to the Upper Rhine, involving equally
great, though different difficulties.

The measure of the southern, or Franoonian Frank oon-

quest‚ is to be found iu the name Frenetes-Gom& this being
to them aa Alsatia is to the AlamannoSuevians, and Bur·
guudy to the Burgundiana.
