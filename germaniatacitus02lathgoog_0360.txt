mitted bc a real one; otherwise, the tradition is only the
tradition of an opinion, ie.. no tradition at all.

A tradition, too, must be different from on inforcats.
All traditione thot casada with informem oro suspiciosam or

tradition).

This, perhaps, requires illustration.

In England there existed, at the time of Beda, three
populations3 one called Asyli, one Scaeam, and one some·

times Jeme, but oftener Vita. ln Hampshire‚ the Sasona ⁸

and Vita, or Jotae, came in contact.

Similarly‚ in the parts about the Lower Elbe and
Eyder, there existed three similarly-named populations;
one called Asyli, one Saaorsea, and one sometimes Vita, but
oftener Jctae. ln Sleswiclr the Sasona and Jotae‚ or Vita,
came in contact.

Now Beda writes that the Jutae of England came from
the Jorae of Jutland; and his statement generally (perhaps
universally) is supposed to rest on either history or tradition.

Ibelieve it tc rest on neither the oue nor the other. l
believe it to be an iasareaoa-an insertato so logically correct,
that I only wonder at the combination of chauces which
make it actually wrong.

Nevertheless‚ the truth was as follows. The people of the Isle
of Wight were called Vtra, even as the people of Jatland were.

And, the people of the Isle of Wight, thus called, lay in
geograplrical contact with certain Saxeus3 those Saxous being
in similar contact with certain Angles. All this was also
the case with the Jatlanders.

Such coincidences wanted accounting for. A migration
did this; and a migration was iasarred.

The extent to which the similarity of name between Gothi
and Geta might engeuder a similar iasaraaca, similarly resem-
bling a tradition, wealrens the historical lihelihood of the
tmth of J ornandes' account.

Such are some of the reasons for considering his derivation
of the Germane (or Goths) of the Danube from the shores of
the Baltio, as highly exceptionable.
