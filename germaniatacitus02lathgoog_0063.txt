x dentnlly. It may safely be said, thet if this has happened at

all, it has happened against grem odds.
Yet the solution is obscure; we cannot well suppose the
Gothi ιο have migrated from the land of the Getam whilst

’ f the notion that the Gctae came from the Gothi, isset asido by
⁵ ᾖ, the greater antiqnity of the former name (Getae).

ls there any other explanation?

In what may be called the Getic hypothesis, it is held that
the Goths were Getae, and the Getae Goths, freta tle dc-
ge'wninp3 in other words, the second of the assumed facts is
denied‚ oia, the origin of the Goths in Germany, end the mi·
gratioe from that country. There was no migration at all. The
Goths were on the Lower Danube from the beginning, and they
were known to the earlier Greek and Latin writers as Getae.

Snch the doctrine. Now, ns there isthe evidence of more
than one good writer of antiqnity, as to the Thracians being in
the same category with the Geta, the 'l'hracians must have
been Gothic ns well. Hence the questions involved in the
hypothesis in questionem of considerable magnitude.

Snch is the point of view from which the views developed
in Grimm's History of the German Langnage, must be
sesnin the first instance. The details by which it is sup·
ported are elaborate, but eminently unsatisfactory. Ressons
for thinking them nenecessary are given in the sequel,* where
the difficulty arising from the similarity of name is admitted,
but differently explained.
