other, wholly to the south of the Danube.

North os tle Donabo, rechoning from west to east, come—

A. l. The Tshelrhs, or Bohemians of Bohcmia.

2. 'Phe Moraviaus, or the Tshekhs of Morevia nearly
identical with the Bohemians-the two languages being but
snbdialects of the common Tshelrh tongue.

3. The Slovaks of Upper Hungary, differing more from the
Bohemiane and Moravians than those two natione do from
each other, but still belonging to the great Tshekh or Bo·
hemian division. The dialecto and subdialects of the Slovalr
language are as numerous as the Slovak villages; afact from
which some inferences will be drawn in the sequel.

The Tshelrh divisionis limited to Bohemia, Moravia‚ and
Upper Hungnry. Both northwards and eastwards, the
character of the lauguage changes. '

Β. Silesia, even at tbe present moment, is not wholly Ger·
man. The Serkie of Lower and the Srbic of Upper Lueatie
are Slcvonie. They do not, however, belong' to tho Tshclrh
so much as to the Lekh, or Polish branch. Hence their
affinities are with their north-eastern rather than with their
south-western neighboure.

l, 2. The Serlrc and Serbs are tho most south-western
members now in existence of the Lekh branch of the Slavonic
stock; a division which takes the form of a separate substan·
tive nationality with—

3. The Poles of Poland, Peren, parts of Gallicic, parts of
Lithuania, and parts of Pomerania.

0. Russian. A modified form of the Itonion, called Rue·
niok, cr Ruthenian-occure usfar west as Gallicis, where
it is in contact with the Slovak of Upper Hungary and the
Polish of Poland. Further to the north it is bounded by the
Lithuauian of Lithuania, Gourland, and Livonin, eud by the
Esthonian of Esthonia-this last being a Finnic language.
Vast aa is the area covered ,by the Russian language, ite
dialecto are remarkably few, a fact which should bc con·
trasted with the multiplicity of dialecto in the Slovak.

And here the north-Slavonic area ends; an area which
we may, if we choose, call Trana-Danubian, since all the
