the middle of the third century* to the present day, the root
Such, or Suro, has been a notice German name for the
Germaas os Suelio. Before this, we hear of Saevi, but their
loeality is not Stadia.

What does this prove? 'lhat Streo- was a German name
previously? By no means. It merely proves that a certain
area was called by the Romans aster a population named
Sueoi, aad that certain Germane who settled there took their
name from the area. Kent, at the present moment, is English,
and the Rvet-iuga who occupied part of it during the Anglo·
Saxon period were English. But does this make Kent aa
English word? No. It isBritish= Cantium, as is well-known.

Up to tle timo is question (aa, the reign of Alexander),
the known facts are quite as much against Setae· being a
German root as in favour of it. Gaesar's Saevi are described
by Gaulo, and Tacitus's are in a locality which at one aad the
same time is different from Caesar's, and Skrooaio. No one,
who has realized the extent to which national names vary
with the languagc of the informante, will say that the root
Suco, as applied to the subjecte of Ariovistus, may not be
as acclusioaly Gallio, as the word Wslsl is molusimly
Germanic.

Hence, up to the timo in question, Saeoio is simply the
name of the country ofa population that the Romans and
Kolta called Sacri—a population which need not even be
Germanic, still less, necessarily, call themselves by Saea.

* This is allowing the term Saeuus, as applied to certain populations and
individuale (eg, Ricimer) hythe Latin writers, an excessivo exmusiou. The
samo authors would hare called Hengn'st, had sneh a personage been in Rome,
ant'ton. Yet he was no such thing. SuchaOherusean, too, as the bro·
ther of Arminius, would also have been called Germanus. Yet anch a name
was strange to the individua] himself. Similarly, Englishmen eall Princo
Alhort a Genaua, end (perhaps) ia speaking English he calls himself so.
Yet hc is a Deutrcle. 'lhese remarks are necessary, since the render cannot
too clearly see that the question is not whether certain Saevi were Gennaes,
but whether such Germane called themselves Saevi. However, as the argu-
ment is put in its strongest form, the objection is not pressed: otherwise
the truly nnexeepticnable evidence of Suco- being o German root, begins
when thc Gennans of Snabia, nnequivoeslly speaking of themselves, iu their
own langnage call themselves Saulem This is much later.
