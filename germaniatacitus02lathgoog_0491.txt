One point, however, still remains: it may be dealt with
briefly, but it should not be wholly overlooked, viz, the ques-
tion, whether, ovsr and above the theorias aa to the location of
the Cimbri in tho Gimbric Chersoneso, there is reason to be
lieve, on independent grounds, that Keltic tribes were the early
inhabitants of the peninsula in questioni If such were
actually the case, all that has preceded would, np to a certain
point, be invalidated. NowI know no sufficient reasons for
believing such to bo the case, although thero are current in
ethnograpby many insufficient ones.

1. In the way of philology‚ it is undoubtedly true that words
common to the Keltic tribes occur in tlre Danish of J utland‚
and in the Frisian and Low German of Sleswick and Hol-
stein3 but thera is no reason to consider that they belong to
an aboriginal Keltic tribe. The a priori probability of Kelts
in the peninsula involves hypotheses in ethnography which
are, to say the least, far from being generally recognised.
The evidence as to the langnage of aborigines derived from
the significanoe of the names of old geographical localities, is
wanting for the Cimbris Chersonese. The arguments as to
the origin from Jutland of certain Keltic tribes in Englaud
(ay, the Picta) either rest upon the historical evidence
that has just been discnssed‚ or else involve avicious circle ot'
argument.

2. No traditione, either Scandinavian or German, point
towards an aboriginal Keltic population for tbe localities in
question.

3. There are no satisfactory proofs ol such in either

arehaeology or natural history. Α paper noticed by Dr.
