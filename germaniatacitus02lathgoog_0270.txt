wora ow secunx xxxv. 127

These with the second empirated (Caeseti, Κοῦχοι) occur in
Velleius Pateronlus, Spartianus, Ptolemy.

Dion Cassius has aa forms Χοῦκις and Κοῦχοι.

Lucan and Claudiam divide the vowels aad make them trisyllabis.
This division of the vowelsis of some importance in the history of
ethnological conjectare, since it brings the forms Ooy‘y'ci and Oaiioi ιο
a resemblance with the Καοῦλκοι of Strabo, and then with the Ohobilci.

The Chauci fell into two divisione-the Ohauoi minores between
the Ilms and Weser, the Chauci majores between the Weser and Elbe.

It is sale to identify them with the Hoc-iopas os the Travellor’s
Song and Beowulf-the termination -s'ay being a patronymic, the
-os the sign of the plural number, and the ct in Chauci equivalent
to Ιι in the same way that 0a=H in otaot and Hae.

It is sate, too, to consider the Chauci os members of tho Frisian
section of the Gothic stock.

In the battle of Tinnssburh, Haoty‘, the eponymus of the Hono·
cericas, the son of Tinn, the son of Tolcvalda, bas, as his queen,
Hildeburg‚ the Hoc-iay. I do not consider that this gives us any·
thing historical. All that it does is ιο connect the Chauci and
unsis (Hociaqe andFrisioas) by certain politicol relations ; and
carry the area of their legendary localitics as far as Hanover and
Hildesheim.

Considerable difficulties are involved in the statement that the
Chauci extended asfar as the frontier of the (lhatti ; difficulties turn·
ing upon the relationship between the Old Saxon and the Anglo-
Saxon languagas.

If we join the Chauci and Chatti, we do one of two things 3 we
either-

a. Disconneot the country of the Old-Saxeus of Westphalia from
that os the Anglo-Saxons: or else vve—

t. Enalose two such important populations as the Old Saxone and
Angla-Saxone within too small an area.

Two other points connected with the ethnography of the Chauci
still stand over.

1. The discrepancy between Tacitus and Pliny as to their physical
and political condition. What Tacitus says maybe seen iu the
text. lt is much the same as Velleius Paterculus bad said before :-
“Recepta (leuchorum nationes; omnis eorum juventus, infinita
comesimmena corporibus, situ locorum tutissima, traditis armis
. . ante imperatoris procubuit tribunal.”
