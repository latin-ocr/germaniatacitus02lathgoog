(lourt, was, upon the latter receiving notification thereos, disinhcrited
by her on the spot, and that in the following words z-“ Here sitteth
Leofled my hinswoman, unto whom I grant both my haud and my
gold, and gown, and dress, and all that Ι own, ulier my day
(death).” “ Her sit Ledfloed min mage, he ic ge-ann agher ge mineo
landes, ge mines goldes, ge braegles, ge redies, ge ealles he ic th,

Nay more, there was one sort of property, ot lecu. which a mar·
ried woman might bequeath even during the lile-time of her husband.
This was the naming-gift (morpmpifa), presented to her by her

several wills, the husband carefully points out the lands to which
his wife has this claim, and, in several cases, women appeal to itas
their title to lands which they are desimus oi alienating.”-Kemble,

ΧΙΧ. Ergo septb pudicitih agunt, nullis spectacu-
lorum inlecebris, nullis conviviorum incitationibus
corruptae. Literarum secreta viri pariter ac femina

teria, quorum poena presens, et maritis permissa.
Accisis crinibus, nudatam, coram propinquis, expellit

publicatae enim pudicitia nulla venia: uon formd,
non aetate, nou opibus maritum invenerit. Nemo
euim illic vitia ridet: neo corrumpere et corrumpi,
saeculum vocatur. Meliirs quidem adhue ece civi·
