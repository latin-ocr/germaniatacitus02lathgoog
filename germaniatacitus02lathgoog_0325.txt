ln en. 26, a Sicambra colors was employed as iar from
its own country as Thrace.

This is believed to have permanently settled in Hungary, on
the very spot whereon the city of Bada was afterwards built.
Iu a work quoted by Grimm, aa [ascriptiones Suororaactae
Vetustata's, a etone said to bave been dug up, “in Buda veteri,
Mathia regis Ungariae tempore, dum fundamenta jacerentur
aedium Beatricis reginae,'' bears the following inscription,—
“Legio sicambrorum hic praesidio collocata civitatem redifica-
verunt quam ex suo nomine Sicambriam vocaverunt.''

The authenticity, however, of this stone is doubtful 3 and,
even if were not so, the ethnological fact it conveyed would
be, in and of itsclf, minute and unimportant. It has been
noticed, however, for a special reason. The fact of Sicam-

inferred.

Bytho end of the liret century, the name Sicambri has
become of comparatively rare occurrence, and the very fact
of its not appearing in the Germania, is aprooi of the ex-
tent to which its greatness bae diminished.

The Frank successam oi Glovis, as well as Oloris himself,
are often called Sicambri. In Gregory of 'Poura' account
of the baptismos Oloris, the bishop says,—“ Mitis depone
colla, Siaamber, adora quod incendisti, incende qnod ad·
orasti.''

In all these cases, however, the term isa titular actaeae
no nation then being called Sicambriaa.

Like Otwroeei, then, Sicambri is a term which occurs
during the early period of the history of the population to
which it applied only.
