For the opinione as ιο the meaning of the term Hermen,
see pp 47-49.

The root dur· re-appears in the Treoua-xantus of Ptolemy 3 a
compound of Terre·- and heinr=tome,· just as Boio-hemum=tlrehovse
of the Boii. All this is pointed out by Zeusa, who expressly says
that Hermae-duri is evidently a compound (ortyerecheialr‘cle compo-
a‘tum) and also that the Τευριοχοῖμαι of Ptolemy means the same
people.

The identification of both forms with the modern form florinum
(Thur-inpia), is equally probable. 'Phe -e'rrp is the gentile or patro-
nymio aihu-consequently no part of the original word.

The change from d ιο ι, which occurs between Tacitus and Ptolemy,
occurs in the more modern forms also3 Duriae: Tar-inp, being the
Old High German word.

'l'his justifies us in considering the population, whose name appears
as the second clement of the word Hermunduri, as the occupante of
the parts between the Werra and the Saule, or the present district
of Thuringia, wherein we find a Perpau.

All this is confirmed by the following observatione of Zeusa
After thehlareomannic war, in which they took part, the Hermun-
duri disappear. Suevia, which, in the Roman mapa, filla up the
country between the Bructeri and Alemanni, in its eastern parts,
representa their country. J ornandas, who mentions Hem but once, .
does so in a loose and general way, end evidently on the authority
of older writers. Spealring of the Vandals of the first halfof the
fourth century, he says-“ lirant namque illis tunc ab oriente Gothi,
ab occidente Marcomanni,a septentrione Hermunduri, a meridie
Hister, qui et Danubius dicitur.'’-G. 22. From this time forwards,
history kuows no Hermunduri, but, from the fifth century down·
wards, Torinpi, Ihoriuyi, end lhuriupi, iu their stead. Thac the
Thuringians are in noviss a different people from the early Hermun-
duri, can be safely admitted, since we discover neither how so con·
siderable a population as the latter, should have been lost, nor
whence such a one as the former could have originated. Besides
which, the later writers alwaya place the l'huringians at the back
of the Franks and Alemanni, and between them and the Saxona,
this being the original country of the Hermunduri.

Upon thelocality of the Hnmundomm οιοίιαο, Ican thrcw no light.

The extent given in the text to the area cf the Hermunduri
requires notice. Tacitus brings them as far south as the Danube.
