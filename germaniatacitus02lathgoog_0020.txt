from taking up the question at the other end, beginning with
a language at the earliest period of its history, inverting the
previous process, and tracing its progress downwards from its
first appearance in history to the present time.

We get, by this means, more than one additional Gothic
language. First and foremost comes—

1. Ta dissotiatis-The tribes who epoho this were the
Goths who conquered Moesia3 the date of its existence, as a
written language, being the fourth century. The Moeso-
Gothic has no living representative, thet is, none of the
present dialects of Germany are directly and unequivocally
descended from it; although the Thuringianis, probably,
descended from some dialect originally allied to it. From
the fact of its being the oldest Gothic dialectos which we
have any specimen, the philological importance of the Moeso·
Gothic is very great.

2. aaa sammaa-This is the present literary German as
it was written in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh cen·
turies, and as it was spohen on the Upper Rhine‚-in Badeo,
Wurtemburg, Switzerland, and Bavaria.

3. Ta Francia—This is German of the middle Rhine‚ as
it was written in the ninth and tenth centuries.

4. aaa Old Dutch, Famae, or Batonius—This is the pre·
sent Dutch of Helland inite oldest form. lt departs from
the Francio much as the Francic departs from the Alemannis.
Hence the Dutch of Holland, and the Bavarian of Ravana,
may be considered as the two extreme forms of one and the
same* group. All the present Platt·Deutsch dialects of
Germany are either exactly derived from the Francic, or
from some form intermediate to the Francia and Batavian:

aview which will be noticed in the sequel.
5. Ta Sason—This falls into two divisione, the Old-

Saxon ol Westphalia, and the AngloSaxon of Hanover,
afterwards transplanted to Great Britain. The Sason lan·
guage is extinct in Germany, being replaced by the Platt-
Deutsch derivativas of the Francis, or Franco-Batavian.
This circumstance supplies us witha principle ol classitica·
tion, the Platt-Dentsch dialect falling into two divisione-
