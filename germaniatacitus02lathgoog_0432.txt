It ie not impossible that the first two Ambrossos may be the
seme pcople, ie, tort Saxone of Britain, rather than British
Saxone, in the first case, and German Saxone (as the trne Old
Saxone were) in the second; since there is some difficulty in
believing an archhishop of Yorlr to have been employed so
iar from his diocese es Westphalia, and a Welsh monk
recording his operatione-Since

a. There may have been certain Old Saxone in Britain;
jnst as there were certain Frisians.

b. Old Sexon might, to aBriton like Nennins, have been

that they called themselves what Festus says their neighbonrs
called them, mon osa bod li o.

The word lere hes thus been enlerged npon, because it
has been put forth as an clement in the doctrine of the
German origin of the Cimbri and 'lantonem to which has
been appended the mors especial doctrine that these Ligurian
Ambroncs were part end paroel of the socelled Germane of
