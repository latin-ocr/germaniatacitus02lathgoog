which, we have s place called Kiergoard ,· and as goard=bousc in
Danish, this is au additional clement in that quarter.

On the other hand the compound Kirkeby=0burebtowm should
be noticed: ss it shows, that, in thet case at least, the Dauish name
is posterior ιο the introduction of Christianity. 1 do not remember
sny such Frisian form as Tjerk-om (the Frisian equivalent ιο
Kirkeby); sfaet which gives us negative evidence in favour of the
antiquity of the Frisian names·

Nollem—For the square formed by lines drawn from Husum
to sleswich, from Sleswick to Illonsburg, from Flensburg ιο Lech, and
from Lech ιο Husum, there is only one place in -ιιιι, Bordel-um, and
as this is cn the right bank of the Tremit msybe considered as
belonging to the true Brisian area, being its most western locelity.
Roughly speaking, the preponderating signs of Frisisu occupancy
cesse when we pass the Tren.

West of this line, and in the series of angular proJections formed
by the Echemljord, the slis, the Flensborg Fjord, the Apenrede

such is not the cese.

a. Between the Eckernfiord and the ses is an Οτι-ιιι, and a
Schwsstrent

t. Between the Slie and the Fiensburg Fiord is o Wrimn, ande
Bmmholem.

c. Between the Blensburg and Apenrade Biords is a Bell-um ;
though quite st the western (north-western) extremity.

d. Between the Apenrade and Hadersleven Biords are Rodum
and Lygetm3 both on the eastern side. ·

In the parts neeesssry to fill up the vacancy, and comprise the
centro of North Sleswich, along with apert of South Jutland,
bounded by lines drawn from Lech to Blensburg, from Flensburg to
Kolding, from Kolding to Ripe, from Ripe ιο Τόοᾱοτο, snd from
Tondern to Lech, we have a few Frisian forms-sellistehauge, ou
the south-east of Kolding, and opposite the isle of Pyen, being the
most eastern3 south of which, aud also nesr the sea, is Stubb-um.

Ιι is scarcely necessary ιο say that the distribution of the Frisian
forms is remarkable.

Birst, we have them to the exclusion of the Danish and Platt-
Deutsch ones.
