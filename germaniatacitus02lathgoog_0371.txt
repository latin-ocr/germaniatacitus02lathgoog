xlviii reseruemur on uacuus

to the J ntes of Jul-land, one being a name in one dialectos
the Old Norse, the other in another; just as, at present,
Gotleabwry begins with G· in the mouth of a Daue, but with
Y· in that of a Swede-Gdtenburg, Ydtenburg.

IV. Is there any connection between the Geta cf Moesia
and the Gothini, the Gethones‚ the Gothlanders‚ the J nt-
laudere, bre, all or any? In putting this question, we must

remember that the country of the aare is the country of the

Gotls also.

The difficulty involved herem, has aheady been indi·
ested*

So bas the explanation of the greatest Gothic scholar
living.

The present writer, in admitting the difficulty, differs
from Grimm, by admitting the migratiortsrom Gcwnouy also.

But he believes that that migration was not undertahen
by Gemens calling themselves Gotho.

He finds no evidence that they called themselves so before
they reached the country of the θεία.

They tlon took the name, aad aot besem just as the
Keat-ings of Anglo·Saxon Englend took a name from the
Keltic county of Kout.

This, however, is only a preliminary consideration. The
real question is whether, or not, the similarity of name he-
tween the Get- of the Lower Danube and the th oi
Gallicis and Prussie be accidentali or is it referable to
ethnological connection?

ln this case, the distance is sufficient to admit of the
resemblance to be accidente13 and I do not prees the relation·
ship. Still Ι believe in it.

The seme Slavonians who, as frontagers, called the one
Guddou, were the frontegers to the Geton also.

In this case the connexion iseortal, ie, it is of the same
sort which gives the same name to the Welrl of Britain,
and the Italicus, whom the Gemens called Wolel alec.
The Germanic populations, which fill up the interval, agree
in calling their ooteGermanic neighbours by some form of
the root w-l.
