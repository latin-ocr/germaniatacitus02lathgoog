which is a name applied not to all eoeSlavonie nations in-
differently, but to those of the Uprion stock onlyffi—See
Proleyom. p. xlix.

But this restrictiori of its application to a single nors·
Keltic population is by no means necessary; since the word
is quite as likely to be in the predicament of the Germanic
ternu Welsh, as in that ol the Slavonic Trltad ,· the word
Welsh being applied not only by the English of England
to their fellone-citizens of the principality, but hy the Ger-
mane of Germeny to the Italiam of Italy.

Now what if Suen- be reelly e root like would, ie, a root
applicnble to two (or more) non-Keltic populations, indepen-
dently ol their relations to each other, and with reference to
the noa-Kelticism onlyl And what if the second of these
populations were the δῑοοοοίοθ

If such be the case, more then one difficulty would lind its
solution.

In the first place, it would account for so many Slavonic
populations being designated as Saevi.

In the second, it would supply a plausible origin for tlre
word itself.

The phonetic systems ol the Slavonic end Keltic, each so
peculian ere each sufficiently different to make such e root as
Surb, Surb, or Sero (the native ‚designation of the slavo
niens), take in the mouth of e Gaul, the form Sauo, duab, or
Suro—and such I believe to have been the ease.

0f course, this view requires ιο be supported by evidence,
that the Kelts tud a name for the Slavoniens at all; and
(although the present is not the place where it will be ex·
hibited) euch evidence ceu be given. The hypothesis also
requires that this neme, as the designetion of a noreKeltic
population‚ should have been given ιο a Slavonic nation first.
Ι think that this also can be mede probable. If so, we must
suppose that the south-eastern Gaulu, end the most western
of the Saxon and Thuringien Slavonians once met ς that the
native Slavonic neme Surb took in Gaul the form ὅπου
that certain Germanic populations displaced those Slavonians‚
and thus came in contaot with Kelts ;-lastly, that the name
