The chief seat of the Ostro-Goth conqueste nes Italy.
‘ Some of them settled in portione of Asia Minor.

a. J ornandce names a king OstroGotlc.

b. With the exceptione of the Vieigoth conquests in Gaul
and Spain, the localitiee of the noro-nothe arc fully ae wect-
werdae those of the eo-called chterrc Goths.

o. The combination etr in the river Ister, ie identical with
the combination -etr in Oclr=cnst

All thie throne a shadc over the uenal interpretation of
the prolix Ostro. At the same time, nothing very serious
depende on the etymology.

The most important question connected with the Octro
Goths and Viri-Goths, iethet of their original name.

If they were not called Goth till they reached the land of
the Geta, under what name did they leave Germanyf

Under that of Glut-cnys and Thero-lnge: these two desig-
natione being those which, to say the least, have the best
claim to be considered the native names of the great Gothic
conquerors of the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuriee.

ln Mamertinus and Eutropius, wefind the forme Teroio9i;
Ammianns'e formis Theruingi. Trebellius Pollio (in Obsco-
dio) hae the name Virtinyc'o3 which has, reasonably‚ been
considered to be a transposition of Tranioni. or Tercinyi.
The similarity of the name Tlos-ing· leaves as little doubt in
the mind of the present writer, as to the Tlercinys of Dacia
having been originally the Thurioyiane of Thorinyia‚ ee there
ie about the Anylse of England having once been the Anybe
of northern Germany.

The evidence in favour of the Grnttmye is less satisfactory.

a. The teminctlon only is buron to bc German; the
root is only temperent to be eo.
b. More than one writer calls them Σκνθαί.

c. The following passage distingniehce them from the
OstroGotlle-

Ostrogothis colitur mixtisque Grntuogis
Phryx agen-Claudias.

But as even the undoubted Gotho are called Scythicos by

Zosimus, the second objection‚ the strongeet of the three, ie

bnt slight.
