'I'he Barariau aide os the great Alpina chain consiste os au
elevated table-land, tha Italian of a series of mountain-walleys,
which change in character aa we approach the alluvial plain of
Lombardy 3 and as these change, we pass from Rhatia to Italy,
from the Tyrol aud Switaarland to Lombardy.

At the present moment the population of this area is referable to
two divisione. A German dialect of the Alemannis type is spoken
in Bavaria, Wurtemburg, Baden, the Vorarlberg, and greater part
of the Tyrol. aha remaining dialeots are derivativae from the Latin.
It ia necessary to know that these last fall into two divisions3 the
Italian os Lombardy, the Valteliue, aud Tessino, aud the Ronmnoe
of the Grisons or Graubriindten. It is the Grison or Ursubrtindten
country which is pre-eminently and typically Rhatian 3 the Gaison
mountains are the Rhaetica Alps, and the Gtaboa form os speech
is often called the Rtoetioa langnage.

If, from the Lake ol constance, we follow up the Rhine towards
its source, we find that river aad the lnn rise on different sides of
the same range of mountaina. Now the valleys of the Upper Rhine
and the Upper Inn constitute the Grison country, where the Ro·
mance language is spoken, and where it falls into two chief dialecto,
coinciding with the two river-systema. The proper Romanoa is the
languagc of the hille aud valleys on the Upper Rhine 3 the Ladtoo,
or Latin, that os those on the Upper Iun. Thon subdialeots occur 3
the Ladino falling into the Upper Eugadino, and the Lower Enga-
dino3 the Romrum into several similar ones.

Such is the present philological ethnography os the Rhaetias.
But aa both classes of languages hare been introduced into the
country within the historical period—the German in the fifth and
aiath centurias, and the Roman in the time of Augustus-neither
throws much light upon the character of the original population.

Were there any Germana in Rhatiai Germane might have been
found in the northern point of Vindelician Rhatta, just as there
were (immane in Gaul 3 ia, aa intrusive emigrante, bnt not as inte
