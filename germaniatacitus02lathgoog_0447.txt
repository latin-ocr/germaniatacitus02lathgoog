At one time Ι was inclined wholly to disconnect the name
' Angyleia with the Angles ; holding that it meant the Aegle (or
nook) of lund, and was, simply, a geographical term misunder-

found that there is a maed Auple district to the south of
Leck, and in the Frisian country; a lact which invalidatea
the previous view.

But, even if this be granted, it is only evidence to the fact
of there being Angles in Sleswiek at tbe time osBedu; and
then they arc in the Slavonio part of the island, on the Baltio
side of it, and in an arce no largcr than the county of But·
land.

Ι still think that the Angli of Tacitus were-

l. The Angles of England—

2. Occupants of the northern parts of Henover-

3. At least in the time of Tacitus-

4. And that to the exclusion of any territory in Hclstein,
which was Frisian to the west, and Slevonio to the east.

Still tbe question is one of great magnitude and numerous
complicatione, involving, amongst other difficulties, the impert

information.

That the Saxone, however, of Englend, came from three
small islands, and a fraction of Holstein, and the Angles from
afew thousand acres on the wrong side of the peninsula, is a
doctrine benet with objections, and intrinsically improbable.
