That there was, at lcaet, ons body of Gauls on the German side
of the Rhine, is a fact ιο which we have (laesar as a witness. His
language respecting the Volcae Tectosages, is that of a man speaking

· · ιο what he hncws at firsthand.

Tor the locality of such Trans-Rhenane Gauls, in the time of
Oaesar, no district has a better claim than Baden and Wurtsm·
burg-the apri Decccwtes of Tacitus. We come to this con·
clusion hythe exclusive method. It was not Switaerland‚ for
that was Hslretian; nor yet the Middle Rhine, since, in those
parts, there seems ιο have been Germano of the Alamannia
division.

The import of tha name Voluce Tectcscyes is by no means clear.
Of the two words comparing it, the former (Volsca) was panerio, the
latter (Tectcscycs) specillo, since, besides the division in question,
there was a second—the Volow Arecomici.

Tha area of ths Volcae of Gaul in general seems ιο have been the
parts between the Rhene and the Pyrenees3 but as the name was
probably collective rather than special, the history of the votcae oi
Gaul is obscure. Caesar mentions them only incidentally.

How ths (lauis beyond the Rhine came thither is another ques·
tion. They may have done so by simple intrusion, οἱα, just as
Caesar was told they did. This intrusion may have been either
early or late-as late as the times approaching those of (laesar
himself, or earlier than the well-known migration-real or sup-
posed-dcscribed by Livy, and referred to the reign of Tarquinius
Priscus-Lib. v. 34, 35.
