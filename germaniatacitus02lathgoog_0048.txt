exactly coincide with the area of the British lunguage, it is
not an isolated instance.

ln the time of Tacitus the parts between Moravia, ual-
hcia, and Hungary were occupied by natione speaking thre
different langueges—the German, the Pannonico licpcu of
Tacitus, and the Gallica lingua of Tacitus. ¹

At the present time three tongues meet in the same parts
-tne German, the Slovak, and the Polish ol Gallicis, the
Majiar of Hnngary being e fourth; but that is of late intro-
duction.

Now if we assume much migration for these parts, the
migration must have been of the peculiar kind just indicated,
a chemical migration, so to say, a migration plus substi-
tution and replacement3 a migration which, whatever it did
in the way of an indiscriminats abolition ol all nationality, at
least left the boundaries of three different languages‚ eud
their geographical relations to each other, much as it found
them.

certain writers, however (as already stated), adopt the view
of e German migration from the parts between the Elbo and
Vistula sufficiently exhaustive of the original population to
leave the country in a state of emptincss for the Slevonians of
the parts further eastwards to fill up. These, as they horrow
their notion of a coccum from the science of physice, may
take their theory of replacement and substitution hom the
chemist. Valeat pacatius.

Such the displacement. Whence came those who effected
itt Not from the country east ol the Guttones. There were
uo such Slavonians there. East ol the Guttones (the supposed
frontier people of Germany), the populations were wholly
either Lithuanic or Finnic until the last few centuries, and
are nearly so now. This, then, is no birthplace for the
Slavonians of Mechlenhurg and Pomerania.

Did they come from the south-to, from Bohemial No!
Bohemia, according to the hypothesis, was German, besides
which, their langmage was, probably, less like the Bohemian
than the Polish.

Then they came from Poland? Not even this. Poland
was occupied by Lygian Germana.
