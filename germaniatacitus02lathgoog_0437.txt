from the mund-system of the different Slavonic langoages
Thus, the sounds ahin ιο the 9 in porr, and the kin kind, are
not equally distributed over the Bohemian, the Polish, the
Russian, and the Lithuanic. No Slavonic tongne has the

four souuds of p, k, ll, and Ιι. Each has two or three of
them. Thus-

Βοιοιηιοο k · kh hwith guanting.
Laaotion k - kh h „ guanting.
Itonion k g kh - ‚, twauting.
Polish k g kh - „ twenting.
Bulgoriorr k g hh - „ luanting.
Illyrica k g · - „ lclcndlruanting.
Litluom'c k g - · ‚, leland luanting.
*Letoia k g - - „ khandtwanting.

Hence, where the Poles say p, the Bchemians say l,-
whereas the Russian spella such foreign words as Horolcl and
Hcrlch, Gcrold and Gcrcop,· there being no sign for h. So
that if a Bohemian and Lusatian wished ιο pronounce anch a
name aa Get, as a Pole pronounced it, he would fail in doing

so, and say Hot instead; and olco verso, a Lett would
change Hot into aot.

Ι admit that these facts require the initial in the words
Jotae, and Jotlcmp, ιο be H rather than J.† On the other
hand,l think that, aa His the modern form, J may have
been the older one; in other words, that the change fromp
to l may not have been direct and immediate, bnt as fol·
lows t-q‚ j (y), Ιι.

1 submit that these remarks are sufficient reasons for the
existence of amco difference at least in the forms of the names
in question, if not for the exact differences which we actually
find. Thus much concerning the change from p ιο j (p).

The one from j toccan, in like manner, be shown to be ι

no arbitrary assumption, but a true and proper letter-change
of the Slavonio-Lithuanic languages.
