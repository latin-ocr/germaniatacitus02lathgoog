is a word of Roman makc; one which never has been deve-
lcped in the country itself.

That it is foreign wc know3 and we know it because it
has been assigned within the memory of man. But what if
it had been assigned in the obscure days of the third and
fourth centuriest lt would undoubtedly have passed for
native.

At the sometime Ι admit that, in order for one nation to
adopt the name by which it is known to another, there
must be a very favourable combination of circumstancest
ay.-

a. There must be a considerable difference in the power
of the two populations; the weaker taking the name from
the stronger only when the fact of its relative weakness
is evident.

d. Or there must be intermixtum.

c. Or there must be more than one nation tc use the
foreign term, whilst only one npholds the native.

Contrary to many, I am dissatisfied with the evidence which
makes two very important words native and German—
Suclia (Saevi) and Socors. Ι think each of these was di-
rectly Bootae, and remotely Kcltic. Hence, to the objection
against their ooo-Germanic character, founded upon their
undoubted adoption by undoubted German populations, l
suggest the fact that their adoption was favourcd by the
support of two languages (the Roman and the Kcltic) against
the German single-handed.

More specific reasons will be found in the sequel* At
present I merely illustrate a line of criticism.

'l'he etymology of national names is generally considered
a powerful instrument in ethnological research.
. lt is doubtful, however, whether much hasbeen done by it.
ch writers 'admit any one's etymologias but their own.
This is a proof of the arbitrary method iu which the practice
is carried out.
