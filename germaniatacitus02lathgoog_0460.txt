Now, it is not statiug too much to say that all this oon·
stitutes a wholly new end undeveloped line of criticism.

That different authors should differ in the forms they give
the different new and strange names which they meet with iu
the geography of imperfeetly known countries is natural; but
that one aud the same author should vary is strange. Yet
such has been the ease with both Strabo aud Ptolemy, and
that to a considerable extent.

distant as not, when certain problems are under notice, to be
brought to bear upon eaeb other.

Now the case which was made out in the § on the Gotho,
