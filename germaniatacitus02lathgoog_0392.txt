Gallias appetunt, egressique ad terraspapam unum de regno
Theoderici devastant atque captivant, oneratisque navibus
tam de captivis quamde reliquis spoliis reverti ad patriam
cupiunt. Sed rex eorum in litus residebat, donee naves
altum mare commendarent, ipse deinceps secuturus; qnod
cum Theoderico nuntiatum finisset, quod scilicet regio ejus
fuerit devastata, Theodebertum, filium sunm, in illas partes
cnm valido exercitu ae magno armorum apparatu direxit.
Qui, interfecto rege, hostes navali proelio superatos opprimit,
omnemque rapinam terrac restitnit.”—iii. 3.

Now from Beownlf we learn that the papas of the Franks
who killed Hipaluo was that of the Hatraaera.

In a document of an. 769, wa find—c Silva quae vocatur
Hebri, in aquilonari parte fluvii Rnrae.''

Later still we find the form Hace, and, at the present
moment, there is a town called Heia-ingen, on the right bank
of the Ruhr, between Eneca and werden*

These names, then, as well as that of tho town of Ennea,
give us the area of those Germana who were called in Platt-
Deutsch-

a. Olattuarii, or Att-uarii.

b. In High German Haza-oarii.†

Whose name also was either compound or simple, ia,
Chattuarii or Odatti, Haaaoarii or Hcaaa,· this latter form
being preserved in the present form, Essem which is High
German in respect to the as, bnt Old Saxon in respect to the
omission of the initial aspirato.

In Tacitus (Amr. i. 50, 51) we find a notice of the Siloa
aaa, the locality of the Marsi, and the seat of the worship
of the dea Tassaaa.

This looks like the name of the country ahont Easan in its
oldest forms.

The connection between the Marsi, Gambrivii, and other
populations belonging to the Sicambriaa division, with the
Chattuarii, is somewhat doubtful.

The name may have originated in the root Oas- of the
siloa Casio, and so have been older than that of the popula·
