ment, I must anticipata a part of my inquiry. Good writers
have identified those Grrddons with the Gorneae Goths. As,
however, they by uo means overlook the fact of the Ombos
being Lithuanic, they must suppose that the name was
retained from that of the earlier Goths subsequently replaced
by Lithuanians. In which case, the newer inhabitants,
instead of retaining the name which they brought with them
from their own country, took that of the older population.

Now even in its most moderate form, this assumptionis
considerably opposed to the usual course of ethnological
changes, or rather the usual course of ethnological changes is
opposed to it. ln the first place, there are two cases of the
incorporated and amalgamated aborigines of a country taking
the name of their conquerors to one of the converse process.
Thus Franco takes its name from the German Franks, and
England from the German English, instead of the Franks
taking their name from the Gaula, or the Angles from the
Britons. Still the converse takes place sometimes; eud, as if
for the sake of invalidating the very connexion in question,
one of the best instances of it is supplied by the very district
under consideration. As far as any change took place at all
in respect to the conquerors of the parts about the Lower
Vistula it was just the contrary to the particular instance
assumed to be the general rnle. The German Prnssians of
Prnssia did take the name of the aboriginal Pras.

Now if the name Paroreian were adopted by the conquerors,
who were really Germane, from the conquered, how unlikely
isit that the lower orders—the rural population of the agri-
cultural districts, pre-eminentlytenacious of nationality, who
were really Lithuanians, should adopt the name of any
previous Germane. In this respect, then, the assumption
that the term Guddoa is procl of the Gurdorws being German
Getta is faulty.

Again—-that the term Guddou comes from Gothos-is
generally admitted. Even, es it is, the preservation of it
is remarkable. But it becomes doubly remarkable if we
assumes total change of population to heve taken place
between the time of its first application and the present.

As it is-the population being supposed to bave remaiued
