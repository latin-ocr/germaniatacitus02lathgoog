4. The Finlanders call tho Germane Saeua. This is
weighty.
On the other hand—

1. Νο clear distinction has ever been drawn between, ap,
an Angle of Suffolh and a Somou of Essem.

2. The Romans, who knew, for some parts at least, every
inch of the land occupied by the Saxons of Germrny, as long

as there is reason for believing that they took their names
from German sources, never use the word Saeuo at all. Ιι is
strange to Oaesar, Strabo, Pliny, and Tacitus. (See note in

more German than anything in the form Saxon.

ο. With such words ae Nordalbingii Wcst-phali‚ and Ang-

6. Whotever were the relations between the Anglea and
Saxons, populations dffamtly related were called Saxone
