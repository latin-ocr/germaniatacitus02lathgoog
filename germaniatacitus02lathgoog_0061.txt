It by no means follows that, because the Germania of
Tacitus constitutes a very large tract of country, the whole of
the area occupied hythe Germanic stock was therefore known
to that author.

He writes that it was separated froni Dacia and Sarmatia
montibus aot motae meta

This is not the language of a precise geographer—indeed,
preciso geography for the parts iu question was iu Tacitus's
time an impossibility.

Hence, any writer who may hold that there was a Germany
or Germans, either to the north or to the castos the limits
ascribed in the Germania, holds nothing unreasonable. The
Dacians and Sarmaticus might only have iounrupted the ont-
line of that area; in which case Germana might re-appear ou
the Lower Danube, or in Westcrn Russia, Germane of whom
Tacitus knew nothing, aud of whom he had lost sight on
reaching the Dacian and Sarmatian frontier.

There is nothing unreasonable in all this; and the likelihood
of the Germanic area of Tacitus being amella, is just as open
a question as the likclihood of its being lorger, than the real
oue. Indiuidually, 1 believe it to be too wide ς’ but that is
uo reason why others should not consider it too narrow.

This has heen done. The greatest authority of Germany
has expended much learning and ingenuity (language more
favourable than this cannot be applied to even the arguments
of the grem author of the Deutsche Grammatilr) ou what
may be called the Getis hypothesis.

Let it he admitted that the chauces against the name ofa
locality reached hy a body of emigrante, invaders, or con-
querors, being identical with that of the locality from which
those emigrante, invaders, or conquerors started, are almost
infinite.

Thus, the chauces are almost infinite against theoretice
