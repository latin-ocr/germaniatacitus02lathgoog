Now what is this division of the Oroatians ba as old as the time of
Tacitus? aud what if the Germana translated the name in early times,
ewen as the Turks did afterwards? In this case the name Osi repre-
sents the German Weisa= Wkite, and the Oai are the Wlta Oroottons
uhdsr their German name, and Wisberg (Οὑῖσέοὸργιοι ol Ptolsmy)
is Wtite-hill (or town), and ewen the mysterious Aah-iburgius Mona
is Weisshesy.

No objections against this lie in the current notion that the Sla-
wonians of the Danube did not make their appearance in history till
the sirth century-the notion itself being not only objectionable,
but almost osrtainly inoorreet· All that we fairly gat from the evi·
denoe of Procopius and others is, that it was the sixth century when
the populations ol the Lowsr Danube became known as Sirmium,-
just as it was the third when the Westphalian and Hanowerian
Germana bacam known as Saxona, or those of the Lower Rhine as
Franks, and just as three populations out os four throughout the
world are known at different periodo of their history by different
names. The reasonable suggestion of Zeuss that the Aravisci
are the population os the Raab, is a real complication. So is
the name of the river Caena in the probable territory os the
Oai.

The complement to this note is not. in w. Osi in the sequel.

'lhat 0s= Weia is, perhaps, hy itself, unlihely.

'lhat :treviae :Hhorooitsh is also, perhaps, by itaelf, unlilrely.

But that a part ol theArooisoi called osi, should = Weiese ΗΙιονο-
oisclae is not unlilrely-the evidence being os the sort called cumula-
ιὶοε, where two small probabilities maha ona great ona.
