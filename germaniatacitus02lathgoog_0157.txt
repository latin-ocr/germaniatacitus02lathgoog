The fact oi rein in German meaning οἰιον, and the possibility os
the Blasio fluas = tte clear stow, is the only reason that has ever

This distinction gives risc to the consideration of some points of

The more amicat the direction of a river-other things being

The more hericontei the directiou of a river-other things being

A little consideration explains this. Difference of latitude isa .
