If so, (lber-oeci is au adjective, and the ec· is the -so in
Brittisc‚ the -ek- iu Dan-ele, and the «ist in seli-iat.

li so, the population to whom it applied, must have called
themselves by an edp‘miool appellationr and this is no more
than the present Danes and Suades do‚-Dan·slce, Steti-sko.

If eo, the -d- is omitted; and this is no more than what
occurs in the form Nor-ake, from Nor-dehe-the fuller form
being Hartsdska or Clerodeke.

ln Beowulf and the Traveller's Song, we find mention
of a town with a palace in it, called Heorot.

Near this Heorct the Hecto-dardos were deleated; a
population at no great distance from the Angles-probnbly
either the Bardo of Hordeonio, or the Langobards of Tacitus.

Except that the Hertz is a mountain-range rather than a
town, Heorot=Hortz‚ of which it is the Low German form.

l also think it was the country of the Heredes. Alco, of
the Proper occaect-though, l admit, that it carries thern
usfar east aeit is eafeto do.

Hence, I consider that the Harudes were the Cherusci
in the most limited sense of the term, and the Old Saxone
the Cherusci in the widest; the one name being that by

which they were known to their wetere, the other that by
which they were known to their saturn neighbonrs; and
. although their political extinctiou is doubtful, their diminished
importance (noticed by Tacitus) may bave favonred the sub-
stitution of one name for another.
The following lines justily us in placing the Cherusci so far
eastward as has been done:

Venit accola silva
Bructerus Hercynia, latisque paludibus exit
Cimber et ingentes Albim liquere Cherusci.
Accipit ille preces varias, tardeque rogetus
Annuit et magno pacem premanere donst.
Claud. De iv. Cous. Honor. 450.

The Cherusci were part of the Eastphalians (captati) of
not. in v. Angrivarii. l
But Ptolemy places the Harudes in the Cimbric Cher· l
sonese, and so (perhaps) does Beowulf. This is a grave
objection tu the previous doctrine.
