PROLEGOMENA. cxv

Mo'ser has shown clearly that there is no ground whatever for
secking information respecting our forefathers in the foresta
of North America, or the islanda of the Sonth Sea, and yet
people seem at present again inclined to go back to their
notione. I do not mean to say that the habitatione of the
ancient Germans were the same in every respect aa those
of the present time, for in winter, ay, they were, no doubt,
obliged to have ligbts in the day-time, all the openings of
»tho house being closed with boanda as they had no glass
windows; bnt this was the case iu Rome itself; and similar
honses still exist at Rome. Ι cannot, indeed, sea why our
ancestors of the fourtecnth century should have been much
mora civilized than they were in the time of Augustus. Ma·
robodnus, however, seems to have had a kingdom which was
really in a state of civilization, with fendal institutione which
had arisen out of his conquest of Bohemia; for that country
had before been inhabited by Boians; that is, Kelts. Ti·
berius intended to attack him on two sides; he himself
assembled his troops in Noricum and Vindelicis, and his
legate, Sentius Saturninus, was to advance from the Rhine
through the Hercynian and Thuringian foresta. The Romans
made great preparatione, in constructing their roads through
Germany. In this campaign wa meet with the first traces
of the unhappy divisione which characterize the whole· his-
tory of the Genusum the northern tribes would not assist
Maroboduus, because he had not assisted them3 he had
allowed their power to be broken, so that, in fact, they
hardly could assist him; they also mistrusted him, because
they believed that it was his intention to make himself
master over them, as he had over the Marcomanni. ¹* * ⁴* ⁴
Maroboduus had done nothing during the insurrection of
the Pannonians and Dalmatians, although he must have
known that preparatione had been making against him.
The whole of that part of Germany which lies between the
Elbe, the Rhine, and the Westerwuld, recognised the supre-
macy of Rome, aa early as the year 760; the Ghauci, and
other tribes on the coast of East Friesland and Oldenborg,
were aa much subjecta of Rome as the Bructeri aud (lhe-

rusci in Westphalia. Quintilius Varus, who was desgeuded
