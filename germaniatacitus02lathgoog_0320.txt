sorus ou securos xevr. 177

It is just possible that the Bastarnae were Germane-not thatI
mean by this that the proper area of the Germane reached so far ae
'l'hrace and Moesia, the Bastarnic locality‚ hut that the Germane oi
the Danube, might have began their encroachmenta in ιιι eaeterly
direction thus early, and hare reached thus far. They might hare
been ireneias Germane in the quartem where Livy places them.

But it ie far from being certain that eren this suppositionis
necessary. Strabo’e statement merely goes to their exhibitiug Ger·
man characteristica, and having Germane in their neighbourhood.
Pliny is rarely to be taken aa an independent witness. Tacitus
spealrs explicitly ae to the most characteristic faets; yet doubts as
to the iniereme from them. In oue point he is either wrong or in-
explicable. If eada mean yaoyraplcc'cal position, his statement is
wholly incompatible with all that writers say about the locality
ot* the Βιιιιιιιιι (on the Lower Danube), aud the limita cf his own
dammula.

Ι think we may saiely say that, ia the passage oi Strabo which
makes the Bastarnae German, there is aqualifying expression of doubt,
and iu that of Tacitus doubt and unsatisfactory language ae well.

Refereme to other writers increasea rather than diminiehes the
complicatione.

Liry's evidence makes them Gaulo ,· since he calls their lesder in
one place (llondicue dux Bastarnarum (xl. 58) and in another
(applyiug to the same series ot* ereum) Clondicus, regulus Θαὶίοιιιιι
(xliv. 26).

He also writes-“ Per Scordiscos iter esso ad mare Hadriaticum
Italiamque. Alia via traduci exercitum nou poeee. Facile Bas
tarnis Scordiscos iter daturus 3 nec enim aut lingua aut moribus
aquales abhorrere.''

Now whenewer the Scordisci are referred to any of the recog·
niaed divisione ot* antiquity, they are called Γαλάται, or Galli-
whether rightly or wrongly is another question.

Plutarch does the same as Livy-‘Yasxs'var δὲ (nempe Perseus) καὶ
Γαλάτας, roric περὶ τόνἽστρον ᾀιημένους, cl Baardpvaa καλοῦνται-
Via Paul. AEmil. c. 9.

The Bastarnae were distinguished from their neighbours—warlihe
as these were-by superior brarery, raet statuae, and intense lore ci
fighting-'Ardpsc ὑψηλοὶ μὲν τὰ σώματα, θαυμαστοὶ δὲ rdc pali-ar,
μεγάλαυχοι δὲ καὶ λαμπροὶ ταῖς κατὰ τῶν πολεμὶων darrileio-Pht
