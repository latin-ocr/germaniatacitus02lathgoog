. patriation.-“ Eodem anno Cheruscorum gens regem Itomb petivit,
amissis per interna bella nobilibus, et uno reliquo stirpis regia, qui
apud Urbem habebatur, nomine Italicus. Paternum huic genuae
Flavio, fratre Arminii 3 mater ex (latomere, principe Chattorum
erat”-hnn. xi. 16. Even if we refer a great part os thieto Roman
intrigue—a probable assumption—tho evidence that the recognition
ol the great clement oi hingly power-desecat-vas as true a charac-
teristic of omae of the early Germans, aa the sense of personal liberty,

is unexceptionablc.
At the same time, it is possible that, in the more fenny and inac-

cessible parta oi Friuoland, parts less surrounded by conterminans
nations, the approach to either a republican or a patriarchal govern-
ment may hare been closer; the East Trisians, of all the Germana, at
the beginning of the period oi undoubted history, being republican. i j

The name Italiam (and, besides this, there are several other in-

stances of Germana with a Roman name) shows the extent to which . ι “

certain individuale, at least, of the Germanic na'tion were Romaniasd.
· The German equivalent of what Tacitus randers rec (or rather the Ἃ,
German word to which Tacitus uses rea as an equivalent) was pro·
bably cyning in Angla-Saron, kuairw Old High German. How
far, however, this was a derivative from the word cyae=9eraus (ltin)
is uncertain. The best authorities have connected the two.

‘Ducerd—The German word to which duc stands in the same
relation aa rec does ιο cyrtam is uncertain At the beginning os the
literary period ve find AngloSaxon hodoco, and Old High German
beroaeobo the equivalents to ὀνκ and at the present day ber-wellam
in High German, and ber-tu9·dcm in Danish mean date-dom.
thther, however, the combination lora-ty vas as old as tha time
os Tacitus is uncertain.

Perhaps the oldest form of our word eorl (eorl Angla-Saron, jort
Norae) has a better claim-at least lor the Saxona and Scandinavians

The fact that makes the compound brt-ty doubtful is the pos·
sibility oi the German word top having originated out of the Latin
duc (duc-s).

Supposirig, however, the two words to have existed, it is probable
that the beri-rope found his duty on the marcion, the eorl in the more
central parts of the country.
