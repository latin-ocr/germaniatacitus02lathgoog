nnequivocally Sarmatian, without traoe or vestiga of any pre-
vious Germanic population—no German names for the rivers
or mountains, and no Germanic strongholds in any of the
impervions foresta and impracticahle fena-no traditione on

the part of the Sarmatians of their own comparatively recent
arrival in the country. That any portion of the present Ger-
manic population of the oonntries in question is deseended from
an ancestry earlier than mo. 800, is what no one has ever
ventured to essert, so evidently is it of recent origin, and so
totally has any older population—if snoh ever existed—died
off without leaving traca, or ahadow of a traoe, of its
existence.

Poorercaic, ant os tlte Odor. -Adam of Bremen first
mentions these Pomeranians, and he mentions them as Slavo·
niens, the Oder being their bonndary to the west. On tho
east they were conterminons with the Prussians. Their name
is Slavonic, po=oo and more=aeo,=coaotmea. All their
antiquities and traditione are equally so; in other worda there
is neither evidence, nor shndow of evidence, of their ever
having dispossessed an older Germanic population. Nor are
“ they wholly extinot at tlre present moment. On the promon-
tories which project into the Gulf of Dantzig we lind the
Slavonie Kanate, ementita, or Kaaut. Their langnage
approaches the Polish.

Pomerooio, meat of tlte Odor, aad tle emtorcpart os Mecl-
autore-No definite notiees of these parts occur before the
time of Gharlemagne. From that time downwards, however,
they are numerous. The only Germana that they recognize are
the conquering invaders. On the other hand, the Slavonio
populations are carefnlly enumerated‚ and so thoroughly do
they fill up the whole area that there is neither noolr nor
cranny for any thing German. The chief nationis that of
the wilzi, Welatabi, or Lintioi, falling into the minor divi-
sione of the Olizziai, near the present town of Rostoclr, the
Oireipnni, on the coast opposite the lsle of Rngen, the To-
looai, on the Tollensee, and the Retlrarii of the civitas Ratlre.
Now, whatever the others may have been, these last were no
new-comere, since the town was praeminent for its antiquity,

and the temple which it-contained celebrated for its sarrctity.
