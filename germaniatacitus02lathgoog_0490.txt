similar silence of the Keltic ones, since the Gothic legende are
the most numerous, and the most ancient. Besidee this, they
deal very especially with genealogies, national and individual.
The name of Bojorix, a Oimbrie king mentioned in Epitome
Liviana (lxvii), is Keltic rather than Gothic, although in the
latter dialects proper names ending in -ra’c (Aleria, Gesseris)
frequently occur.

Meaeuring the evidence, which is in its character essen-
tially cumulative, consisting of a number of details nnimport-
ant in themselves, but of valne when taken in the mass, the
balance seems to be in favour of the Cimbri, Teutones and
Ambrones being Gauls rather than Germane, Kelts rather
than Goths.

An argument now forthcoming stands alone, inasrnuch as it
. seems to prove two things at once, oia, not only the Keltie
origin of the cimbri, but, attha same time, their locality in
the Ghersonese. It is brought forward by Dr. Pritchard, in
his Physical History of Mankind, end runs as follows:-
(a.) It ie a statement of Pliny that the sea in their neighbour-
hood was called by the Cimbri Mor-imarum, or the dead eea=
mura raorluum. (ὂ.) It is a fact, that in Keltic Weleh mor
murwtl=more moneam, morimarueu, deod eeu. Hence the
language of the (limbric coast ie to be considered aa Keltic.
Now the following facte invalidate thie conclusion 2-(1.)
Putting aeide the contradictione in Pliny's statement, the
epithet dead ie inapplieable to either the German Ocean or
the Baltic. (2.) Pliny's authority was a writer named Phile·

· mon: out of the numerous Philemone enumerated hy

Fabricius, it ie likely that the one here adduced was a oon·
temporary of Alexander the Great; aad it is not probable
that at that time glossee from the Baltic were known in the
Mediterranean. (3.) The subject upon which this Philemon
wrote was the Homeric Poems. This, taken along with the
geography of the time, makes it highly probable that the
original Greek was not ulpepor,but1<rppe‘pror; indeed we
are not absolutely sure of Pliny having written Cimbri. (4.)
Aa applied to Cimmerian eea the epithet deod was applicable.
(5.) The term Morimarueu=maro murrum, although good
Keltic, is better Slavonic, since throughout that stock of lan-
