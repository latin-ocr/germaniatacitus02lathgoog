Plutarch mentions that their warcries were undenstood
and auswered by the Ligurians. Now it is possible that the

Ligurinas were Kelts, whilst it is certain thet they were not ἶ

Gotho.

Tito Teutoocs.—Appian speaks of the Teutones having in·
vaded Noricum, and this under the head Κέλτικα.

Florus calls one of the kiugs of the Teutones Teutobocchus,
anama Keltic rather than Gothic.

Virgil has the following lines:-

—Late jam tum ditione premebat
Sarrastes populos, et quae rigat mqnora Sarnus3
Quique Rufras, Batulumque tenent, atque arva Celcunae3
Et quos maliferae despectant moenia Abellae:
Teutonico ritu soliti torquere cateias.
Tegmina queis capitum raptus de subere cortex,
AErataque micant pelta, micat aereus ensis-AEn. vii. rat-74³.

Now this word coteio may be a provincialism from the neigh-
bourhood of Sarraste. It mayalso (amongst other things) be
atrus Teutonic word. From what follows, it will appear
that this latter viewis at least as likely as any other. The
commentatore state that it is ooo Celtica Thet thia is true
may be seen from the following forms—Irish: pa, apocr,
jocatim panti, diuo, adam pothaopcor (O'Reilly); poottndt,
c jocetio‚· padi, speum pai, ditem· wenc potat, spaer-
siost (Begly)—Cornish: geu, pecc, pu, eckharto, apocr,
jocelin, alost (Pryce)-Breton: pons, poaff (Rostremer).

considering the peculiarities of the Keltic pronunciation‚
this word cateth is perhaps the pesum of another part of
Virgil, and the ὑσσ-ός of Appian, as well as the English
word good.

Gallio origin, we here, in the way of direct evidence, the
testimonies exhibited above, cia, os Sallust, (liceto, Casan,
Diodorus. To this may be added, that of Dion (lessius, who
not only had ascesa to the contemporary accounts which
spolie of them as Gaula but also was enabled to use them
critically, being possessed of information concerning Germany
as well as F rauce.
