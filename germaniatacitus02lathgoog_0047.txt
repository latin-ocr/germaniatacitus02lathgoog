’ the uinth century, was undoubtedly divided between these
Lithuauiaus aud Slavoniaus, absolutely German even in the
eyes of Tacitus. At the mouth of the Vistula the AEetye'e‘
spoke a language like the Britislt.

Let these AEstyians, on the strength of their serato Bri-

tormicae propior, be called the aoreGermanic portion of the ·

scr-called original Germanic area; and-

Let the Praesidae, on the strength of their Lithnanic
tongue, be called the aoaSlavonic portion of the same area as
it appears in the leth century.

lt will be found that the relation of the aoreSlavouic
portion of the Slavonian period, was exaotly that of the aaa·
Germanic portion during the Germanic period-ie„ both the
AEstyiane and Prassians occupied the same locality.

Hence, the displacemeut of these BritartaaGermaaio popu·
latione (and the statement of Tacitus is as valid for the
AEstyians speaking a language like the British as for any
single fact connected with these parts) must have been accom-
panied with a remarkable act of discrimination—since the
parts occupied by the populations like the Brc'tr'sh became
Litheartic aud not Slavonio, the remaiuder Slaooaic and
not Lithaaaic. This nice appropriation of different parts of
the different areas cannot be said to add to the probability
of the migration which must be assumed. Such a migration,
annihilating the population, traditione, and local names, aud
all the substantial realities of a vast district, aud, yet, pre-
serving the form of its ethnologioal area, is, to say the least,
a very remarkable oue; since it gives us a pheuomenon

A further consideration of the probabilities herein involved

But it may be urged that the lauguage of Tacitus respect·

closely! Grauted. But what statement is more explicit.
If we doubt or qualify this, why not doubt or qualify much
more; ey, the Germanic position of the Lygii. This is what
should be done. All that is required is consistency.
