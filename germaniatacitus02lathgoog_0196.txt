NOTES ΟΝ SEO'l’ION lx.

One of the marginal notes is the following couplet.—

“ Quem modo polluerat cultura nefaria dudum
Gallus monticulum huno tibi otae tulit,”

which, in the Angeburg Chronicle, appears in the body of the
extract.

It may, then, be safsly said that, in the thirteenth century, the
memory of a local goddess, named Zaba, was preserved in the neigh-
bourhood of Augsburg 3 and, although the parts about that city
were, strictly speaking, Vindeliciau rather than Saeuis, it may fairly
be supposed that the cutm extendcd into the true Sueoic area

'Phe following fact diminishes the difficulties involved in the
difference of form between Isia and Ziza

a. Meisterlin, who wrote about au. 1456, has the form with
the final ·s, “ Occu-der g'dttinn oea, die auch genent wird Cissis.'’
This accounts for the final a.

t. une form Bycen occurs. Grimm quotes the expression, “der
amasonischen Augspurger japetisch fraw ,sym

At the same time, it should be remembered that the writers who
speals of Frou ΕΜ, may hawe been disposed to the adoption
of that form hom the name Isis in Tacitus. Hence the evidence
in favour of the omission of the initial 0 or Z, is not nnexcsp·
tionable.

That the present text influsncsd the views of the later writers
concerning the Augsbnrg goddess‚is certain3 such a phenomenon
being by no means unusna13 since numerous instances could be
adduced to show that an inaccurate account of a superstition in an
influentisl writer, has acted upon the superstition itself-just as
oemain prophecies fulfil their own accomplishment

At any rate, in ths sixteenth century, we find Frcu Isia with
certain attributes, which may fairly bo considered as foreign, and
superadded to those of Oica. Some of these are deduciblc from the
notice of Tacitus ; others referable to other sources of confusion.
Thus, Jean le Maire,writings.1>.1512, says, “Au temps doquel
la deesse Isis, royne d’AEgypte, wient en Allemaigne et montra au
rude peuple l'usaige de mouldre la farine et faire du pain.”

Aventia (about ao. 1522) says that it was hom Frons Bycen, that
iren (German eum) took its name, adding an account of her amau,

wherein mention is made of the stip, and Hercula is said to have
been her father-See D. 11. ἱ, 244.
