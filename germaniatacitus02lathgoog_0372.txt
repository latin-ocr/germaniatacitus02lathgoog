But, besides this negative character of being aoreSlavonic ,
(and therefore called at), the two populations in question
may have been really connected.

A reason in favour of this (as far as it goes) is found
in the fact of the Slavonians differing from the Germane
in the following particulare :-

The Germana ,called all aoreGermans by one name-
Weoll.

The Slavonians varied the name with the different οοο-
Slavonie populations with which they came in coutact.

Thus-they eall the Finns Telos, aad the Germane
Niemcy‚· and this is a reason for thinking that they called
none G-t, hut the Lithuanians.

Further reasoning on the subject occurs iu Epiloyomeaa,
§ lue relatione cy* tle cao to ladio.

Ne objections lie against the aaa and Golfrooes being
equally Lithnanic, from the mere magnitude of the area.
If Slavonians eonld extend hom Servia tc Poland‚ Lithu·
anians might from Balgatia to Prussia.

The objections that erise from the present limited area
of the Lithuanian tongue are but slight. The limits of that
tongne have ever receded.

Lastly‚ it should he remembered, that whatever facts
brought the Gethones nearer to the melior, brought them
nearer ιο the ⁴(lota also.

Such is the hypothesis3 which, whether convineing or the
contrary, issuhmitted ιο scholare with a claim to their
carefnl consideration. It explains the forms Goth, Gelo,
Gothland, Just-land, Goth-inus, and Gotho, without assuming
any migratioo dy laod at all; only troo by water (one of
which is down a navigabis river, and the other across'a sea
of moderate breadth); any displacement so great as that
which is known ιο have occurred over part of the same
area within the historica] period, and any power given ιο
any term more general than that which connects the names
Wolsd as applied to scombro-Bricca, aud Wolsl as applied
ιο an Italian.
