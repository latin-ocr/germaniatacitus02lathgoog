most northern province of Scotland is called Sotlealand,
from the same relation to Norway.

It was, probably, amongst the Φιραῖσοι of Ptolemy that
the Norse tougue aa opposed to the Frisian was developed.

What time was required for thisl It is difficult to say.
Not, mamuraly, a very long one.

One of the great distinctiva grammatical characters of the
Norae is the socelled passive voice. We know that thie has
been evolved nearly within the literary period of scandinavia.

The etheris the poet-positive article, Now this exista in
Wallachiar'r; though it did not in Latin, ia, Lat. ille homo =
Wall. hom-ul. The reign of Trajan, therefore, is early enough
for the one form. Such being the case, no longer period is
needed for the second.

The time, however, may have been much longer—but I
only indicate amiciorum.

Again-there may have been other Frisians than the
Φιραῖσοι of Ptolemy: but I only take what Ι find.

Throughout this argument we must remember-

'l'hat Goth, as a German name for the Swedes of Gothlaud,

Goth, as a Lithuanic term, is wide aud general, and
accounts for the names Gothland and J utlaud as well.

What follows is the brief notice of some of those names in
Strabo, Phny, aud Ptolemy‚ which may reasonably be applied
to populations within the German area, but which have not
been mentioned by other writers sufficiently to give them
much historical or geographical prominenoe. They are,
probably, thc names in detail of the divisione aud subdivisione
of some higher groups already noticed!
