Lithuanic must be explained by cithera migration, or an
original continuity of area.

The presumptione have been determined. Let us now
choose between these altematives.

The ludo-European population may have been continued
from Asia into Europe (or vico arrad) by two lines—

1. One to the north-

2. One to the south of the Caspian Sea.

The difficulties, each way, are the same in amount, though
different in kind.

l. On the north we have the vast traete of independent
Tartary, the water-systema of the Lower Jaik und Volga,
in which the Indo-European population which, by assump-
tion, was continuone from the Oxus to the Dnieper‚ has
wholly disappeared. Now the more we go book the wider
this interval becomes; since, the Russians, at the beginning
of the historica] period were further from India than they are
now. The supposed displacement, then, in this quanter must
have been enormons. The further objections that ariae ont of
the distribution of the existing Turk and Ugrian families of
the area in question (a distribution which makes it almost
impossible lor an IndoEuropean population ever to have
been on the north of the Carpion), are ιοο numerous for a
work like the present.

2. A prolongation of the Indo-European area in the
direction of Asia, and ιο the south of the Caspian, is, at the
first view, practicable enough. And here the remark that
whatever brings Litluaaiu aoorcr to India dimiaislcs diffi- .
entelechias its hearing. Let the Getae be Lithuanians, the
Thracicos may be Lithuanio also, since more than one good
authority of antiquity identifies the two. Then the Bithy·
nians were Thraciam—which brings the European Lithuanic
half-way, or more, to meet the Indo-European dialects of
Western Persia. Be it so. The Armenian language is a

stumblingblock. lt ought, from its geography, ιο be inter·
mediate to the Sanskrit and Lithuanic- whereas, that it
is IndoEuropean at all is more than many good judges
allow it ιο bc. Αι any rate, it is not what it ought to bc
for the hypothesis-transitione] in character.
