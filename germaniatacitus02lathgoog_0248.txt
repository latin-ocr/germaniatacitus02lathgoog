ferre impetus, disponere diem, vallare noctem, for·
tunam inter dubia, virtutem inter certa numerare:
quodque rarissimum, nec nisi ratione disciplinae con-
cessum, plus reponere in duce, quim in exercitu.
Omne robur in pedite, quem super arma ferramentis
quoque et copiis onerant. Alios ad proelium ire videas,
Chattos ad bellum: rari excursus et fortuita pugna.
Equestrium sane virium id proprium, cito parare
victoriam, cito cedere. Velocitas juxta formidinem,
cunctatio propior constantie est.

name are :-

1. 'l'hat duaci and Here are one and the same word.

All this is a matter which has been generally received by those
who first worked it out, ria, the German philologists, Zeuss, Grimm,
and others. Whether, however, the real nature of the change has
been explained, or rather whether arry change at all has taken place,
is uncertain. As far as I can ascertain the views of the writers in
question, their opinion seems to be that those Hessians of Hesse who
coincided with the ancient chatti, called theruselccs by that name
(Chatta). If so, the old form has changed into the new one, and
the word which was now Hcssc was once timui, the change having
taken place on Hessian ground, and under the influence of time
alone.

'l'his is not the view which the present writer adopts, He sees
no grounds for bellering that the Hessians ever used, as their own
