J ornandas, also, states that, ‘⁴ Daci, ex ipsorum (oia, Scaud-
zire cultorum) stirpe progressi, Herulus propriis sedibus expu-
lerunt,”-reversiug the order of the expulsiou.

Be this, however, as it· may, we have the evidence of two
writers as to the geographical and political coutact between
the Derras and Heruli, aud this, if taken without criticism, is a
reason in favour of along Heraclion migration from north to
south.

But it is not conclusive. If the Dani were called Daci,
the Daoi may be called Dani, and, as it is much more certain
that the Heruli came iu coutact with the Dacians of the
Danube, than with the Danas of the Baltic, a reasonable ob-
jectiou lies against the evidence of Procopius aud Joruaudes.
1 do not say that it is conclusive. Ι only show that, whenever
we havea leugthy migratiou, we have the· elementa of a
reasonable doubt to set against it.

Eveu if we lay but little atress on this, we have the fact
that neither Jomaudes nor Procopius are satisfactory wit·
nasses to events so distant in both place and time.

They, probably, speculated and inferred: seeiug that on
the Danube there were two populations with names so like as
Daci and Geta, and on the Baltic two others with names so
like aa Daci aud Gothi, Gcotaa or Gnatae.

But how came the similar names to run in pairs l Dones
alone ou the Baltic, and Daci alone on the Danube, would be
nothing very remarkable. N or yet would Geta on the Danube,
and cacas on the Baltic. But Gaae side by side with Daci
iu the south, aud Dani (called also Daca) side by side with
chnra in the north, supply a mystery.

This is a repetition of the difficulties oi §5 on the Angli
and Wcrr'ai of Thuringia, aud it is a difficulty ot* the gravem
character that meets us too osten elsewhere.

Accideut is out of the qnesti0u; and l admit that a migra·
noa, within a certain degree of probability, is the best solution
of similar problema. But it must be probable; aud it must
stand ou the phenomeua which it will explain almost exclu-
sively. Such a migration receives but little confirmation from
any so-called traditious; because the very ease with which it
explains the phencmena, engenders the disposition to assume
