Undonbtedly the pronunciation bere ridiculed is that of
the Ganls, and it is just possible, that in it is foreshadowed
the cnrtailcd form that the Latin tongne in general pnts on in
the Frenoh. Again, the slave whose contage failed him when
ordered to slay Gaius Marinais called both a Gaul and a
Cimbrian by Plutarch, as well aa by Lucan. In the latter
writer, we have probably but a piace of rhetoric-Pharsalia,
libii.

Amongst tribes undoubtedly Gallie, the Nervii claimed dc·
scant from the Teutones and Gimbri. The passage of Tacitus
that connects the Nervii with the Germane, connects them also
with the Treviri. Now a well-known passage in St. J erome
tells ns that the Treviri were (laulst- Νέρέιοι ἦσαν δὲ

Finally, in the Life of Marino by Plutarch, we hove dialogncs
between the Cimbri and the Romans. Now a Gallie inter·

Such are the notices bearing upon the ethnography ol' the
Cimbri. Others occur, especially amongst the poets; of
thess, little οι· no nse can be made, for a reason indicated
above. J nstin speaks of embassies between Mithridates and
the Cimbri. Suetonius connects the Cimbri with the Gallie
Senones; he is writing‚ however, abent Germany, so that his
evidence, slight as it iaia neutralized. Theories monnded
upon the sational name may be raised on both sides ; cimbri
may coincide with either the Germanic krmpo=a warrior or
stampiso, or with the Keltic Oymry=0amdriarsa Eqnally
equivocal seem the arguments drawn from tbe descriptione
either of their physieal conformation or their manners. The
silence of the Gothic traditione as to the Gimbri being Ger·
