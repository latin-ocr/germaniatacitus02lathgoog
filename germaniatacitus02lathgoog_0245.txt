Lastly-slthough we can, by considering the Batarian chatti
to have been an inconsiderable and intrusive population, get over
the difficulty arising out of the High-German dialect of the Chatti,
and the Platt·Deutsch of the present people of Holland, we are not
at liberty to do so. According to Tacitus, the Batavi were eo far
from standing alone, that the Canninefates were in the same catagam,
-—“ Oaninefatea ..... ea gens partem insulae colit, origine, lingula
virtute par Batavis, numero superantur.”—Hist. iv. la.

2 Mattiacorum.]—The mention of the warmbaths of the Mattiaci-
“ Mattiaci in Germania fontes calidi trans Rhenum ” (Pliny, xxxi. 2),
-fixes them in the neighbourhood of Wisbaden. 'Phia isZeuss's
inserenoe; and there seems no good meson for refining on it. The
fact afa mixed army of Chatti, Usipii, and Mattiaci, besieging
Mayence confirma this view. “Maguntiaci obsessores mixtus ex

Caesar, a ἀοὸαιοὸἱι laad between the Gauls and the Germana.

Niebuhr exproesly states that, in the reigns of Augustus and
Tiberius, Suebis was not yet subject to Rome; his reason being
that no mention ie made of any attacks upon Germany south of
the Iahn. Although this view rests upon negative evidence, and

' is qualibed by the statement that all that is lrnown about this war

is vagus and indefinite, the a priori probabilitiss are in favour ol
it, and it would be hypercritioal ιο retine upon it.

Domitian’s actions in Germany are, probably, underwalued.
Niebuhr mentions his war with the Ohatti about tho hlaine. lle
also admits the evidence of medals as to the title of Gemwaicus
barneby Domitian ; buthe demurs to tho evidence of Martial as ιο
its being deserved 3 adding that “ the historiens are unanimous that
those victories were not realities, though they cannot he wholly
fictitious.'’ In the subsequent lecture, he supplies the additional
statement that the “ Ara Floria the name ol a place on the military
rond from the hlaine ιο Augsburg proves that, probably under Domi·

He adds, in a note, that Frontinus (Strateg.i.3‚10)expreesly
