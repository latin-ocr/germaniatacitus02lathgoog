Pliny. Their locelity ie now under water3 being, probably,

1. Sturii, seems a true proper name.

2. Marsaci, ie, probably, a derivative from the root Marah

3. The Istaevones, the people of a Kesteoon, whatever
the import of that name may have been.

the terme, were in a predicament different only in degree
from that ola writer about England, who at Grimsby or
Boston‚ had heard that the whole oownty was divided into
Lindeey, Holland‚ and Kauana, and applied hie informatiou
to the Britieh empire at large.
