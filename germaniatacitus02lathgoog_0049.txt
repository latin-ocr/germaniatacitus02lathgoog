They cau be brought from uo point nearer than the water·
system of the Dnieper. Yet the water-system of the Dnieper
will not give us the phenomenou required. The language of
that river is eminently homogeneous (Russiau); whilst the lau-
guages of Saxouy, Silesia, Bohemia, Poland, Pomerania, and
Brandenburg„ although all Slavonie, are spoken in nume-
rous dialects aud sub-dialeets. To derive all this from the

Duieper is to deduce the whole from the part, the old from
the new.

We have now taken a measure of some of the improbabili-
ties involved in the doctrine ot' a Slavonic migration to the

Transalbiau portion of the Gonoussa, between the times of
Tacitus and Obarlemague; and though they are undeniably
great, their magnitude is only relative3 and a certain degree of
evidence may everbalauce them. Difficult as it is to believe
that Polaud was ever Germanic, there is, nevertheless, au
amount of testimony which would make it credible. Had au
observer like Oaesar visited the country io perseo, aud known
it as well as he knew Gaul, his dietam would, probably, have
outweighed all other difficulties. On the other hand, had a
writer of uo character whatever classed it emungat the coun-
tries of Germany, Ι should have troubled the reader with but
lew reasons for objecting to him, aud have disposed of his
evidence in a summary manner, by treating his statement as
au error.

The authority of Tacitus is intermediate to these two
extremes.

Implioit and uncritical belief is not always the highest tri·
bute os respect. So far from finding any morbid feeling of
pleasure iu taking exceptione to the statemeuts of a great
writer like Tacitus, Ι have no hesitation in saying, that the
more Ι have criticised the more I have found to admire. So
numerous are the cases where an unscrutiuizing adoption of
his statements only mystifies us! Whereas the admission of
the slightest amount os fallibility gives us an important fact.
Such, amongst others, is the statement coneeruing the lan·
guage of the AEstyii, and of the Gothini (vid. nott, in oo.)

More than this, the very latitude given to the term Germania,
though wrong as far as the facts which it implies are con·
