Between these Tacitus draws the distinction (indicated in
p. 100) by the words baud datm· from which I infer that,
in the case of the first two populations, on this list, to which
the words do aot apply, there was a doubt.

l do not, theu, press the arguments against the Germanic
character of the Vangiones, Triboci, aud Nemetes-though
some serious elements of doubts are opposed to them. Thus-

ο. The name of the Tri-boci is Keltic=the tre- in the
Keltic names of places. But this Grimm has met by sup-
posing it= three, so that Tri-doci: tto three tactor.

b. The names* of three out of seven of their towns are
KeliiG-‘H δὲ ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀἕρὺγογο ποταμοῦ πρὸς μεσημὲρίον ·
καλεῖται Γερμανίο ἦ ἅνω· ἐνῇ πόλεις ἀρχομένων ἀπὸ τοῦ
Ὀὅρῦγγο ποταμοῦ,

Νεμητῶν μὲν, Νοιὸμογος,

'Ennaton—Ptolem.

Still the three German towns may have had Kettic names
in the mouths of Keltic informante.

However, the Keltic forms Oacr, as in Cooaphilly, occur as
well-“ Tutor Treviromm copias, recenti Vangionum, Caro·
cutiam, Tribocorum delectu auctas, veterano pedite atque
equite firmavit . .; mox ubi duces exercitusque Romani pro-
pinquabant, honesto transfugio rediere, secutis Tribocis, Van-
gionibnsqne et Caracotibua.”—Tac. Hist. iv. 70.

The Treuiri and Nervii come nuder a different category.

Respecting the first the statement of Niebuhr, that their
language was German, confidently as it is made, proves nothing.
It assumes the point under investigatiou. The uniikclihood
of the Gallic having maintained itself until the time of St.
J erome, is a matter for the reader to decide. The German of
Sarte and Trodicc Communi (Protopomcnu, § xi.) has main-
tained itself longer. Thc fact of no mention being made of
