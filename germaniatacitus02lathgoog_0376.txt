’ nlo-Agara Hist. i. 6.

Notwithstanding this, I think it is an open question,
'whether the name may not have been applied by the truer and
more uneqnirocal Germane of Snabia and Franconia, to certain
less definitely Germanic allies from Wurtembnrg and Baden,
-parts ot' the Decumates agri—parts which might have
supplied a Gallio, a Gallo-Roman, or even a Slavonic clement
to the confederacy3 in which case, a name so Gorneae as to
bave given the present French and Italian name for Garunnay,
. may, originally, have applied to a population other than
Germanic.

Iknow the apparently paradoxical clemente in this view3
but Ι also know that, in the way of etymology, it is quite
as sale to translate ull by alii, as by omnes: and I cannot
help thinking that the ol· iu Alo-manni is theol in altr-arto
(a serapam, or mon of another sort), eli-benzo (on alien), and
oliland (coptieity in foreign hom-Gumm, ii. ons-Recht-
salterth, p. 359. And still more satisfied arn I that the At,
in Alemanni is the ol· in Alsatia=elsass=olisatn=soroipn
settlement. lu other words, the prelix in question is more '
probably the cl· in else, than the ol· in all.

Little‚ however, of importance tnms on this.

The locality ol the Alemanni was the parts about the
Limes Romanus, a boundary which, in the time of Alexander
Sevems, Niebuhr thinks that they first brohe through. Hence
they were the Marchmen of the frontier, whoever tbose
Marchmen were.

Other such Marchmen were the Sueoi,· unless, indeed, we
consider the two names aa synonyme. Zenss admits that,
between the Sueri of Suabia, and the Alemanni, no tangible
difference ean be found.

The area whence wc bring these Alemanni, or Sneri of
Suabia, must fullil certain conditione.

It must not be too limited; since it Is the area from which

not only the agri Decumates were Germanized in the first
instance, bnt from which, eventually and indireetly, Switzer-
land and Austris have been, partially, Bavaria, wholly, Ger-
manized.
