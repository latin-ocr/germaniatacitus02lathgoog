Usipetes, or Usipii ,· a populaticn which, unless Ptolemy
mention it under the name Vispi, he does not mention at all.

But Wisbaden is not too far south for the most southern
Uatinii. Perhaps not. We must remembor‚ however, that
thoy resch as far nortl as Hollaud‚ ia, the country of the
Tra-bonta (Taceatltc).-Epilayomeno, § 1.

§ nxrn. nnn Νούσιπες.

The Νούσιπες (Nolam) of Strabo; known only as wo
know the Laudi, ia, as members of the great Arminian con-
federacy‚ or, at least, aa Germans, led in triumph for the
victory that avenged it.

Probably, Uayii, under another form; especially as the
[lechii (as such) are not mentioued by Strabo.

§uxta nnn xatta, Κζοῦψὶζκοιὶῐίαθύλκοι, Καμψιανοὶ,
μ ανο.

1. Against considering the Χαῦὸοι as the Aviones of Tacitus,
there are no great reasons. Neither are difficulties created,
by making it the name of a separate substantive population.

2, 3. The other names are more problematical.

Thus,-

Besides the Καθύλκοι and Καοῦλκοι, Strabo mentions the
Glauci, distinguishing between them and the latter. Still the
names are elika-the more so when we find Glaucus made
trisyllabic :-

--- non indignante clauco
Pascat Belga pecus—Claudiam De haud. Stilich.

Thon there are the Oleliloi of Gaul-See not. in ammata
omna.

4, 5. Καμψιανοί and Ἀμψανοί are names suspiciously
alike. Yet they both occur in the same writer-Strabo. ·

o. Are both, or either, Ampsioara'il

b. Are both, or either, the people of the parts about
Kongton in Overijseli

c. Is one one, and the other the othert
