The name of one of their chiefs inmodicas namo of
doubtful origitur but as Ammianus expressly calls him a
Goth, he must be considered aa such :—“ Hanc (Frigeridus)
Gothorum optimatem Farnobium cum vastatoriis globis vagan-

3. The names of their leaders are almost exclusively Ger·

The second is neutralized by such extracta as the following
