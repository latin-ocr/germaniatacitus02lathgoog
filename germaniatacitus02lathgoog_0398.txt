lt is when we can lind an undoubtedly Germanic popula-
tiou in this country of Samio calling themselves Saevi,
that the reasons in favour of its native origin begin to pre-
ponderate; since the indigenons nse of the name at one time
is strong prima socio evidence of its indigenous nse at
another.

whether, however, it be strong enough to set against the
series of facts with which the investigation commenced com-
bined with the easy explanation of them by the hypothesis
that the word was originally other than German, is submitted
to the consideration of the reader.

All the difficulties are reducible ιο a single fact, niz,
that the present undoubtedly German name Suedio has arisen
out of a Εοηιαι rather than a notice appellation-the Borma
name itself having arinen out of a Keltic‚ the Keltic‚ perhaps,
out of a Slavonic. Whoevcr malres a difficulty of this should
remember that the word Gsmnay itself is in the same
predicament.

But this implies that the ancestors of the present Scabiosa
became sufficiently Romanized to take for themselves a national
name, which the Romans hed originally taken from the Gauls
-a strange name, in short. The following extraots suggest
the answer to this :—

“ Avitus, on his arrival in Rome, was acknowledged
emperor; bnt Ricimer, a Suevian of royal desccnt, was now
all-powerful in the city. All the barbaricus, who acted a
prominent pert at Rome, must not be looked npon as savages;
they were Christiane, and spoke and understood the lingna
cubaria, which already resembled the Italian more than the
Latin3 they were just as civilised as our ancestors in the
middle ages. A few oi them had a shadow of classica! edn-
cationes Theodoric‚ the Visigoth, and the younger Alaric:
bnt the case was quite different with Ricimer and his equale,
who no doubt heartily despised the culture of the Romans.
Those Germane, unfortunately, were not ons shade better
than the effeminate Italians; they were just as faithless and
cruel. * ¹* ³ * Gundebald, king of the Burgundians‚
who had now become patricias, and snccecded Ricimer, pro·
