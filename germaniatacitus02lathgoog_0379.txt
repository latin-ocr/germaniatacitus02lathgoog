the true Burgundians, ina manner the very reverse os the
preceding remarks.

The Mapoviryyot of Ptolemy, on the Thuringian frontier,
were Burgundian.

But these Μαροῦιγνοι are Merooiagioos.

Hence, the Merovingians of Franco are Merovingians,
not because they were the Merovingians of the conquerere of
that empire, but because they were the Meroviagisns of Bur-
gundy, or (perhaps, more specificelly still, of) Francke-
Comte. ' ·

ᾗ xul. THE nasammonas OF eninr.

It is stated in the preceding chapter, that part of the
history ot' another and different population may have hsen
attributed to the Burgundians of Burgundy,

Pliny (H. N. iv. 14) writes, “Germanorum genera quisquo:
Vindili, quorum ‘pars Burgundiones, Varini, Carini, Cottones.
Alterum genus lngaevoues, qnorum pars Cimbri, Teutoni ac
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi antem Rheno Istaevones, quorum
pars Cimbri mediterranei Hermiones, quorum Saevi, Her·
mundari, Chatti, Cherusci. Quinta pars Peucini, Bastarna
. . contermini Dacis.”

This place, with Daci, Vindili, Varini, Carini, and Guttones,
is somewhat strange fora people of Franeonia. lts proper cles-
sificatiou was, surely, with the Suevi, Hermunduri, Chatti, tec.

To this it may he added, that there are several isolated
actions, such os a contest with the Coths, and another with
Fastide, king of the Gepida), which give us Baryaadiones too
far down the Danube, to leave the history ot' the Burgundians
of Burgundy so simple,as it was left in the chapter referred to.
ln other words. there must bs either migration or another

population called· Barprmdioa.

The second alternative seems preferable; indeed the exist·
ence of such asecond populetion is so certain, that the question
is, not whether there were two Burgundies, bnt which of the
two it was thet Fastida (or the Goths) fought against, and
which it was that Pliny meant by Burgundiones.

a. I think that these two were the same.
