I believe such ιο have been the ossei ,ule previous occupency of
the valley of the Nsab (st least) by Germane anterior to the invasion

of the present Bavarians, is necessary to account for their presence
on the Danube, in the second, third, sud fourth centuries: besides

which the present text requires it

une present text slso requires that they should be either Hermun-
duri, or closely allied to them.

The reasons for believing the Hermunduri to heve belonged ιο s
different section of the Germans (indeed to have been the chief
branch of the Moeso-(lotha) will be found in the sequen*

Whether the Narisei were Slavoniaus like their neighbours on the
castor Germane like their neighbours on the south, is, notwith-
standing the text, en open question. ,

As Narieei, sve have no further specillo ethnological informetion
about them.

lf. however, we allow the Οὐαριστοί of Ptolemy ιο be the same
people, we get a second notice of them; a notice, however, which
adds nothing ιο our knowledge, merely doing what is dous by
Tacitus, ie, placing them next ιο the Hermunduri (Τευρωχαῐμαι).

Το get any new facts, we must go further still laet the word

For the Prench districts of Jnrs aud Doubs, on the banks of
the river from which the latter takes its name, we have the following
notice r-“klustasius ad Luxovium regressus est Deinde sd Wo-
raseos, qui partem Sequanorum provincia et Duwii amnis fluenta ex
utreque ripa incolunt, pergit.”- Vua S. Sulcberyoe.

l'his speaks only to the perple. une following, however, goes
further, and gives us the hypothesis as to their origin :-“ Pergit
(sc. Eustasius) progrediens Waresoos ad fidem Domini nostri Jesu
(lhristi convertit, qui olim de pago, qui dieitur Stadesanga, qui
situs est cirea Regnum flumen, pertibus Orientis fuerant ejecti,
quique contra Burgundiones pugnem inierunt, sed a primo certamine
terga vertentes, dehinc advenerunt, etque in pugnam reversi, victores
qnoque effecti, in eodem pago Wsresoorum consederunt.”-Vits S.
Ermenfredi.

There is nothing improbable in this 3 the river Regnum being
considered the Regen- Ihsve not, however, been more successful than
Zeuss in finding such s neme es Stadecaeya on any of the maps.
