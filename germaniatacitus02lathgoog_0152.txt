ιο call them so. Thero is no conclusive answer to this objection.

Itis not, however, one which the careful reader ol Cesar, unbiassed
hy German prediloctions, is likely ιο take How clearly does he

recogniso tho Germanic elementa of the character of the Nervii and
others, and how oareful ho is to notify them l

Suroly, it is not ιοο much to say that in aaran time the Pennino
population was wholly Gallie, and not half-German

Now if πο do thia, Livy's credit must be saved by either supposing
that ho need the word Gmaaa with a considerable degree of latitudo,
or else that his statement applies ιο tho time ho wrote about rather
than his own.

l believe tho former to have beon tho cass, and answer the ques-

Noricum, the modern salzburg, and Upper Austris, extended
from the Inn (AEnus) to tho Kahlenberg (Mons Cetius).

The Pannoniae were bounded by tho Kahlenherg, the Danube,
and the Save, and coincide with the south-western part oi Hungary‚
and Lower Austris.

N ow oi these four names for five provinces, Tacitus mentions only
two‚-Rhaetia and Pannonia Of Vindelicis and Noricum he says
nothing—although each reached to tho Danube ; which Rhatia,

Vindelicia, then, he evidently includes in tho area of tho Rhaeti.
