Perhaps the river Moror. It is not necessary, however, that it
should hare any ascertained meaning.

It is against the principles laid down in a previous partos the
work ιο lightly admit as Germanic any nation placed, like the
Marsigni (terga Marcomanorum—eiecisset) beyond the M orcle.

But it is also against other principles to treet a definite assertion
of an author like Tacitus summarily.

We must, also, take the word Saevus as be understood it, ie, as ⁶

meaning (lemnon-not as his present commentator dces, ie, as
meaning Siocoaie.

Hence, there are no yreot objections against the Marsigni being
considered German-or, rather, as they are a frontier populabor,
and, consequently, involsing no serious error either one any or the
other, there is no need for an over-scrutinizing criticism.

Now Ζοιιοο considers that Κόγνοι is a fault in the MSS. for Κότνοι,
which is likely enough. He also thinks that the Κότνοι are the
Kiraios os Dion Cassius, and that the Κότινοι of Dion (lessius arethe
