And, also, that a chief with the Turk name Aspar* (perhaps
a Τυνιῖιὶιιριῗσιι) took part iu their politice z—‘' Οτι Σκίροι καὶ
Γότθοι εἰς πόλεμον συνελθόντες nal διοχωρισθέντες ἆμ-
ᾠὸτεροι πρὸς συμμάχων μετάκλησιν παρεσκευάζοντο· ἐν
οῖς real παρὰ τοὺς ἑῴους ἦλθον. Kal Ἄσπορ μὲν ἡγεῖτο

It is, then, not wholly improbable that the Scire? and
Turulliaye' may have been Turks,· the first, perhaps, af that
etock that penetrated far into Europe. ΤΙιι Sciri, aller their
mislortunes having been reduced in power, became subject to
Gothic leaders, and, finally fixed, as a military colony, in
Styria (Smper-mark, or the Mor-el os ιΙιι Styri).

The notion that Hirli=Sciri is confirmed by the form
Σκί’ῥοι in Procopius, Bell. Gothi. 1ε-Σκῖῤῥους κειὶ Ἀλά-
νους καὶ ἄλλο ἅττα Γότθικσ ἐθνῆ.

But how are we to account for the &iri of Pliny, placed
by that writer so far north as Εκῖορῖα, probably Penelopia:
the Fines country Ξ We may suppose him to have lain under
the same mistakewith'l'ecitus in respect ιο thedistance between
the parts about the Gulf of lliga and the Lower Danube, and
to have made it less than it really was. Hence, as Tacitus
(Germl xnvr.) brings the Ριιισῖιιῖ and Bostar-ac too near the
Fiaas' and Venedi, Pliny does the same with the Scire.

Ιι may be added that, amongst the members of the Ηυιι
confederacy, no clement, in words apparently compound, is
more common than the combination of r aad acompound
sibilaut (sl, alt, tol, dzl); and (as a consequence of this) na
terminationis more common amongst Hun natione than that
of -auri, -scr'ri, &a

'lhat this compound sibilant is just the combination which
is rendered sometimes by ak, and sometimes by st, as is
suggested in not. ad v. Naristi.

Thus, amongst the names which no writer has ever made

¹ This is also au Isaurica name.
