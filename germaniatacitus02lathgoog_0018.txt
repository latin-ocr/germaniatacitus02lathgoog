of them in an earlier stage of their growth; the differenee
between the older and the newer forms of speech being, in
many instances, sufficient to constitute a fresh lonyucye.

we have au ancient tongue without any modern representa-

populations nrsy he their representatives or descendants, and
so on with the others. Or we may change the form of the
inquiry, and, after enumerating such modern divisione ss the
English, the Dutch, or the Biyt-German, may investigate

period of their respective historice.
