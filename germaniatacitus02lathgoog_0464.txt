Snch is the case where the two presumptione differ-one
complicating the other. Yet even theu the case is clear.

When they minoida, itis clearer still. Thus, when we
have a comparativeiy homogeneous language confined to the
smalier of two areas ou one side, aud on the other a multipii-
city of divisione and subdivisione spread over the larger‚ the
presumption that the occupante of the former are derived from .
those of the latter, is indefinitely raised.

To apply these rules ιο the present case-

Northem India, Persia, Armenia, and a small portion of
Caucasus, form the moniam of area that can be given ιο tbe
so-called Indo-European languagcs of Asia.

England, Germany‚ Helland‚ two thirds of Soandinavia
Russia, Poland‚ and all southern Europe, with the exception
of Romalis, Albania, and Biscay‚ form the minimum of area
for the socalled ludo-Europcan languages of Europe.

Now the bost that is allowed to the tongues of Europe is
more than the most that can be given to those of Asia. The
excess may be but smalh still, pro tanto, it shows which way
the presumptionis.

Again-the praetant amount of division that can be got ont
of the Asiatic class of Indo-Europcan tongues is thc Ossetic‚
Armenian, and Indo-Persian tongues3 the latter meaning the
Sanskrit and the ancient iangnages aliied to it, with their
real or supposed derivatives—-the modern tongues of Persia
and northern India.

The leon amount of division amougst the European tongues
is equal to this3 for I submit that the differenoes between the
Latin (with its derivativas) and the Greek, the Siavonic, the
Lithuanic‚ and the several branchos of the Gothic stock‚ are
fully eqnal in valna and variety to those that any principle of
classification can get from the tongues of IndoEnropean Asia.

But more must be added. Eightiy or wrougiy‚ there is an
opinion that the modern languagcs of northern India are not
Indo-European; and-

Eightly or wrongly, there is an opinion that the Armenian
is not [ndo-European-

Yet no one, who admits the term at all, has overtaken
exceptione ιο any of the Indo-Europaeo tongues ot' Europe.
