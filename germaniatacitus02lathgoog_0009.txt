iv PREFACE.

that oia translation of Zeuss’s learned and indispen-
sable work* with an elaborate commentary, was a
mere question of convenience.

Το it I arn under the same obligations as the
learner of a language is to his grammar, his lexicon,

or his text-book3 and it is not saying too much to
add that nineteen out of twenty oi the references and
quotations are Zeuss's.

What applies to Zeuss applies, in a less degree, to
Grimm and Niebuhr.

Nevertheless, though the materiale are the same,
the structure is as different as a ship is from a baro, or
vice verri, both built from the same forest.

That the present results bave taken acompletely
definite and systematis form is more than I think.

Everything in ethnology is a balance between con·
llioting difficulties, and I can only hope that I have
approached a full and complete exhibition of the
ethnology of ancient Germany.

Perhaps, too, the work is rather a commentary upon
the geographioal part of the Germania, than on the

, l* Gernroaio itself—the purely descriptiva part relating

to the cuatonis of the early Germana being passed
over almost sicco pede.

'l'he real difficulties lay in the geography, and the
classificational portion of the ethnology; besides which
it is there where Ι worked with the most conlideuoe.

The chief texts are given in full. 'l'o have fol·

* Dic Dentschen and Die Nacllarsuimme.
The Deutsche Mythologr'e‚ oi Grimrn, is quoted as D. M.
The Deutschc Spraclre ns D. S.
