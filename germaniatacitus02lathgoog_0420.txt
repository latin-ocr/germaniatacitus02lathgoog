Pliny's evidence is the earliest. He places them on the
Baltic rather than elsewhere. “ Nec minor opinione Eningia.
Quidam bac habitari ad Vistulam fluvium a Sarmatis,
venedis, Stiria, Hirris, tradunt.''

The first complication here occurring, is the similarity of ν

the names Hirri aud Satri. Strange that really different
populations, with names so alike, should occupy contiguous
localities. No other writer mentions the Hirri, aud I think
they are but Satri under another name—ia, a name taken
from a different dialect.

Neither does any other writer place any Scire' in the north.

The Olbian Inscriptiou mentions the Σκίροι, along with
the Γάλαται.

Stephanus Byzantinus speaks of Σκίροι, Γαλάτικον ἔθνος.

Procopius joins the Σκίροι with the Goths aud Alans.

J omaudes mentions the Scira‘ as either subjecte or allies
of Odoacar.

If we take these statements without criticism, wc find
difficulties that even the assumption of migratione will not
account forz since, although a moremaut from the Baltic
to the Danube, between the time of Pliny and Procopius,
will account for their presence on that river, it is of no avail
for the Satri of the Olbian Inscriptiou—which is generally
referred to a period anterior to the time of Pliny, ia, the
first or second century ac.

Sidonius makes the Satri part of Arriae army.

Jomandes connects them with the Aluos-“Scire et Sa·
tegorii et oetam Alanorum‚ cum duce suo, nomine Caudex,
Scythiam minorem, inferioremque Moesiam accepere.'‘—De
Reb. Get. 49, 50.

’ The evidence of Jornaudes is important, since Peria, the
notary of Caudex, was his grandfather.

Now, as we are much surer of the Soiri of Jomandes on
the Danube, than of those of Pliny, their ethnology will be
considered first.
