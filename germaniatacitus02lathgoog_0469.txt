the Galatica language, on the day of Pentecost, ia a reason
-as far as it goes. .

Another remark of Niebuhr's upon St. J erome's statement
is exceptionable. He considers that the supposed Gor-maa of
Phrygia was introduced by the Gotbs of the reign of Theo
dosius. Now theIr language would be Maso-Gothia ut
aaa as different from the German of the Lower Rhine, the
only German likely 1ο be spoken at Trevcs‚ as the present
Dutch is from the High German of Switzerlaud and Bavaria.
This difference is that of two mutually unintelligible tongues.

The supposed descent of the Nervii from-the Teutones aud

Cimbri, complicated as it is by tha similar claim on the part 1
of the Aduatici (see not. in v. Nerati) is available only in the ¹
hands of a writer who can throw any light over the deep ἶ

gloom that invests the history of those famous warriors.

Still‚ there is tbe evidence of Tacitus to their being less
Gallio, and more German than the typica] Gauls.

This evidence we shall find is a reprodnction of that ot'
Caesar—for which see praeparata, p. lxxii—where the
two chief texts are marked in Italics, Belpas asse ortos ab
Germanis, and Parauaea qui aaa aomim Garatoni appellaretur.

To this-as an argument the same way—we may add the
present existence of the Flemish language in Belgium sub
ject to the certainty of Flanders having been conquered by

the Franks in the time of Olovis, and the likelihood of their ᾗ

language having been then (aud uo earlier) introduced.

Such is the evidence on oue side. Against it mast be
placed tbe general tone of Oaesar's narrative, where the identi-
fication of the Belgae with the Gauls in all essentiale, stands in

opposition to the exceptional statements aa to the particular ¹

Germaniam of the Paemani‚ bc. 1
But this is, perhaps, neutralized by the fact of his treating ¹

the Aquitanicus who belonged to the Iberic stock, in a similar ,

manner, ia, as Gauls.

The presence of Belgae in Britain, is also in favour of the
Belgae being Gauls; since the evidence of Gerasam on the
other side of the Obanuel, in the tima of (iasar, is eminently
imperfect, aa, tbe legitimate evidence. Of course, by making
the Belga of the continent German, we cau bring Germana
