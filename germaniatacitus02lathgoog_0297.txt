lde not imagine that there tras a second March in this quanter,
ia, one on the Roman (Rhatian, Vindelioian, or Rhatollindelieian)
frontier. I'he Danube served instead.

Of courseall thishas thevalue of presumptive reasoning—no more.

⁴ &antiq-The area of the Quadi seems nearly to have reached
aa far south aa the present province of Lower Austris This bringa
them to the Danube, aa the text of Tacitus requires-“anrae

ommate velut frona eet, putenm Danubi> pergitur.” At the same '

time, thelina 0'f the Germanic March must hare been Irregular, and
the Germanic area north of the Danube narrow. It must also
have extended aa far northwards as Moravia and Upper Hungary.
Up to the time οἱ Tacitus, the political relatione οἱ ιΙιο Quadi are
chiefly with the confederaoies of Maroboduus· Catualda, and the

Regnum Veratianum.

Atterwarda they are chiefly with the Sarmatiam of Hungary.

I know no reasons, except astatement oi Ammianus aa ιο their
erma being like those of the Samso, and the likelIhood of the name

Vannius (omia Quadorum) cf the Regnum Veientanum being the
Slavonic title Pon=Domiaua, for making them Sarmatian rather

than German. But these I think sufficient. Still, aa they are a
frontier population, the remark that appliee to the Marsigni applico

ιο the Qatodi also.
