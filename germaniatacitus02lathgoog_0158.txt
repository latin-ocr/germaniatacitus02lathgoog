changes aa we proceed either northwards or southwards more than it

does in adirection from east to west, or from west to east, the con·
trast between the population of the head-waters, and the population
of the embouohures of long rivers is greater where the difference of
latituds is greatest, and least where it is least-other things, as said
before, being equal

the great vertical rivers of Northern Asia have the conquering
Mongol and Turlrs on their sources, the stunted Samoeids on the
mouths. ’

The great vertical rivers of Southern Asia hare 'l’ibetan moun-
tains, between the thirtieth and thirty-fifth degrees of north latitude,
and Siamess and Camhojians in latitude ten.

The Nile has N egroes in its extreme valleys, Abyssinians on its
table-land, and AEgyptians on its great valloy and Delta

The northernmost Mississippi Indians approach the type of tho
Eskimo, the southernmost that of the Mexicans.

Most of the great rivers of the world are vertical ,· the chief hori·
zontal directions being those os the Amazon in America, the Sens-
gal in Africa, the Hoangho and Kiang·ku in Asia, and the Danube
in Europe.

The horizontal directior of the two great (lhinese rivers undoubt-
edly does much towards determining the homogencous character of
the (lbincse civiliaation. At the same time they help to account
for its isolation.

The direction then is one of differenoe between the Danube as
boundary to Gmnans‘a and the Rhine.

The course of tho Danube determined the migration sastward,
those of the Rhine (and still more of the Weser and Elhe) north·
ward.

Another differenoe between the two rivers is the character of their
water-system. contrasted with the Danube the Rhine has but few
foedera 3 indeed it bas hut few feeders compared with any river of
equal magnitude, unless it be the Rio Grande of Texas. the Rhine
is supported as the mmoir of the Lake of Oonstanoe rather than
supplied by its tributaries. From this it follows that the basin or
valleysystem of the Rhine is preeminently small 3 so that its allu-
rial plains sink into insignificancs when compared with those of the
Danube, or even the Elbo, oder, and Vistula. Whatowor we subtract
from the area of the ralleys of a river, brings the hill-ranges in
closer approximation to the stream, in which we have a mountain·
