their neighbourhood-The Gethones are separated from the

3. Both were—according to the evidence-neither (ler-
man nor Sarmatiam since the Seroiata treated the Go-
thini as attemperare, end the AEsett spolra what Tacitus calls
Eristos.

Do these three points of connection establish an ethuolo-
gical affinity?

I will lay down what I conceive to be au hypothesis capable
of solving all, or nearly all, the difficulties arising from what
may be called the plariproscace of the root Gt, art, in the
two names under consideration.

This is as follows: the root, G-tl, was, in the case oi
the Slavouic and Lithuanian populations, in the same predi-
cament with the root (er-k, in the case of the Hellenic and
Italian.

With the Helleues, Γςαῒκοι was the name of a single popu·
lation within what, in the eyes of a Roman, constituted the
Helleuic area3 and the name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Italians, it was the name, not only for that par·
ticnlar tribe, but t'or the collective Hellenas nlso.

Mutatio mutandis—With the Lithnanians the Gt (ti-d,
G-tt) was the name of a single population within what, in the
eyes of a Slavonian, constituted the Lithnauic area, and the
name was, almost certainly, native.

With the Slavoniaus it was the name not only of that
particular tribe, but for the collective Litluune'cna also.

Thus-the AEatii of Tacitus, the Baete of the Germana,
were called Gattones (Gotloues) by the more northern
Slavonians of their frontier3 just as the Γξαῒκοι ot' Epirus
were called Graeci hythe ltalians of the opposite coast.

And, the Gotttm· of Tacitus were called by a similar name
hythe more southern Slavonians of their frontier, just as the
Athenian Hellenos and others were called Graeci by the
Roman, Campaniam and other Italians.

Such is the hypothesis. I prefer this to believing that the
(lotiones and Gothico? were so much and so thoroughly ona
and the same sectioa of the same brooch as for them to have
borne the samo name from Gallicia to Conrlnud3 iu other
