⁴ Limite ccto.]-Was this limes a ditch, wall, or rampart, or rrae
it a physica} boundary; in other words, does limes mean on artificial
or a natural line os demarcationi The reference ιο Frontinus iu

the previous note partially auswers this. 'Phe limes was an artificial
boundary.

Between the bend of the N echar aud the upper part of the river
Altmuhl, in the neighbourhood of Ohringen, are the remaim of a
sortitied ditch. On the Upper Altmubl they can be traced ofresh3
and they reappeer ou the Danube, between Ploriug and Kelheim.
Part or the whole of this is called the Peusehmauer, or Devil's Watt.
The inferenoe that it isos Roman origin is uuexceptionable. The
exact line, however, has not, 1 believe, been worked out. Neither
hos its connection or οοο-οοῑιοοοιίοο with the Psalddlrnben.

l'be PsalLOrnben is a similar line, running at nearly right angles
with the river Iahn, between Giessen aud Ortenburg.

For practioal purposes, a rough conventional line will do as well
aes real oue. This may be drawn so as to make the limes run from
the Maine ιο Kelheim, ie, from the junctiou os the Maine aud Rhine,
ιο the junction of· the Altmuhl aud Danube. This gives ιο the

Romans rather more thau Zeuss, aud rather less than Niebuhr allows
them.
