traced higher than the reign of Caracalla; and (a fact of
primary importance) they were there ic tle cormtry sy* the
Geta. So they were when Decius and Olaudins fought
against them; so they were when, pressed. by the Hans,
they besought Valens to allow them to pass the Danube; so
they were when Hermanric's kingdom was consolidated‚
and so they were until they invaded Macedonia, lllyri-
cum, Greece, Italy, Southern Gaul, France and Spain. 0f
all the Gothic familias their migratione were the most consi-
derable.

It was a long one that took them from Germany to the
country of the Getae. It was a longer one which carried
them from the country of the Geta to Spain.

Of all the Gothic tribes the Goths Proper have most
merged their nationality in that of the countries which they
invaded. ln Greece, in Italy, in Southem Gaul, and in
Spain, no Gotho are to be found asa separato substantive
people; and no known dialect definitely and unequivocally
represents the old Maso-Gothic. On the Lower Danube
itself, the Goths of the Grimea, now no longer distinguished
by their German tongra, and, consequently‚ no longer easily
distinguishable from their neighbours‚ are their sole represen-
tatives-if such they can now be called. In Germany itself,
the mother-country, from which evenat the beginning of their
history they were already separated, the Thuringian dialect is
supposed to be tho most Gothic, but this-a statement made
by Michaelis-has yet to be definitely confirmed.

But the history of the Ostro-Goths and Vin-(iotha, is no
history of all the populations whose name was (itt, (Μὴ,
or some similar form. Hence arises tho long series of ques-
tions as to whether each population, thus connected in name,
were connected in other attributes als03 ia, whether they
were really Goths, or only populations with a nominal resem-
blance. '

I. lothere any connection between the cortone and Go-
vlint? Three points connect them.
