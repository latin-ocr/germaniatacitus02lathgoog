EPlLEGOMENA.

§xnvrrn ran saxeus.

The hypothesis respecting the Saxons is as follows :-

The name Soron was to the Kolta of Britain, what Ger-
man was to those of Gaul.

Or, if not, what Saevi was-a name somawhat more
specilio.

It probably applied to the Germana of the sea-coast, and
the water-systema of the Lower Ruina, Weser, Lower Elbe,
and Eyder; to Low Germane on the Rhine, to Frisians and
Saxone on the Elbe, and to North Frisians on the Eyder.

All the Angles were Saxone, but all the Saxona were not
Angles.

The reasoning in favour of this view is as follows :—

That Saena was a Britannia term is undenied. The
Welsh and Gaele eall us Sasona at the present moment.

The Romans would take their name for certain Germane,
as they found it with the Britons.

The Britons and Romans using the same name, would be
as two to one in favour of the Kaltio name taking ground.
It would be the Roman and Keltie against a German name
singlehanded.

The only question is, whether the name Saena was eaelo·
nuely Britannia (Kenio), ia, not German also.

In favour of the word being German, are two faeta-

l. The thorongh adoption of the root aaa, as denoted
not only by the use of German writers, bnt by its appear·
anne in Barea, Wea-eea, Sue-aea, Middleeaa. The reason·
ing that applies to Saevi, applies here.

2. The name »serenantem deity, whom the Old Saxone,
on their eonversion to Ghristinnhy, were compelled to for·
swear. This gives us the likelihnod of its being the name of
an epoapmws. l admit that this is repert, bnt not that it is

eonelnsive.

3. The story about wiarep eowro Saena: take your daggerr,
and the deduction fremit, that Soanas meant deppae-moa, isof
no great weight3 with the present writer at least. still, aa

far as it goes, it issomething.
