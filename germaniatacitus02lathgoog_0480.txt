of ideas in regard to their origin, οἱα, their hypothetical con·
nection with the Cimmerii. In this recognition of what might
have been called the simmaco theory, he is followed by
Strabo and Plutarch—Diod. Sicnl. v. 32. Strabo, vii. Plu·
tarch. Vit. Marii.

The next writer who mentions them is Strabo. ln con-
firmation of the view taken above, this author places the
cimbri on the northemmost limit of the area geographically
known to him, oia, beyond Gaul and io Germany, between
the Rhine aud the Elbe: Τῶν δὲ repperirem, ὡς εἶπον, οἳ μὲν
προσάρκτιον παρηκοῦσι τῷ Ὠκεανῷ. Γναρίζονται δ’ ἀπὸ
τῶν ἐκέολῶν τοῦ Ῥήνου adsume τὴν ἀρχὴν μέχρι τοῦ
'kadroc Τούτων δὲ εἰσὶ proprpdraroc Σούγαμόροί τε καὶ
Κίμὸροι. Τὰ δὲ πέραν τοῦ Ἄλὸιος τὰ πρὸς τῷ Ὠκεανῷ
παντάπασιν ἄγνωστα ἡμῖν ecura-Lib. iv. Further proof
that this was the fronticr of the Roman world we get from
the statement which soon follows, oia„ that “thus much was
known to the Romans from their successful wara, and that
more wbuld have been known had it not been for the injure·
tion of Angustus forbidding his generals to cross the Elbe.''
-Lib. iv.

Velleius Paterculus agrees with his contemporary Strabo.
He places them beyond the Rhine, and deals with them as
Germane z-“ Tum Cimbri et Teutoni transcendere Rhenum,
multis mox nostris suisque cladibus nobiles.''-ii. 8. “Effusa
-immanis vis Germanamm gentium quibus nomen Cimbris ac
Teutonis erat.''-lbid. 12.

From the Germania of Tacitus a well-known passage will
he considered in the sequel. Tacitus's locality coincides with
that of Strabo.

Ptolom—‘low the author who most mentions in detail the
tribes beyond the Elbe is also the author who most pushes
back the (limbri towards the north. (loincident with his
improved information asto the parts southward, he places
them at the extremity of the area known to him: Καῦχοι οἱ
μείζονος μέχρι τοῦ 'stadios ποταμοῦ· ἐφεξῆς δὲ ἐπὶ αὔχενα
τῆς Κνμὸρννιῆς Χερσονήσου Σάξονες· αὐτὴν δὲ τὴν Χερσόνησον
ὑπὲρ μὲντοὺς Σάξοναο, amotione ἀπὸ δυσμῶν· εἶτα rasa
