gundy, along with the Frank character of the (geogra-
phically) Burgundian Merovingians‚ give the chief reason
for believing that those tribes who were politically Franks
of the Upper Rhine, were geograplioolly and etiuoloyicolly
Bmguudiaus, at least for the middle portion of thom. The
southern members of this group were probably Suevian, the
northern Hessian.

Again-the relations of the Burgundian Gunther to the
Frank Sighid, in the traditions embodied in tho Nibelnngen
Lied connect the two.

ΙΙ. Flo Franks of the mntem fiesties-The chief tribes
who, ethnologically, formed this district were, as long as
the early name (the name by which they were known to the
Gaulo) preponderoted, Sicambri. In detail, they were Gam-
lrioii, Marsi, Geumi, aud, probably, Ubii, Usipii, and
Tencteri, Bructeri, &c

When known as Germana, the collective name was out
of place3 since Tiberius, Drusus, and the other conquerors of
the Lower Rhine, had not so much to deal with Germano
as opposed to Gaulane with Germane as opposed to each
other. Hence came tbe less necessity for aoollective name,
and the greater necessity for a number ot' specific ones. The
Sicambri of the Gaulo arc now the Bructeri, Tubantes, hac,
of the Gomorra.

When tbe necessity for the distinction between tho de-
pendent Germana of the Roman territory, and the free
Germana of the frontier (March) became necessary, the
necessity oia general name came in again. This general
name was Frank. The Franks of tho Lower Rhine seem to
have been chiefly PlattDeutsch, though, partially, Old Saxon
and Frisian as well.

The time of the actions of tba Franks of the Lower
Rhine, was a little later than that of those of the Upper; but
it lasted longer. Its development consisted in the conquesto
of Oloris and Obarlemagne. Its measure is to be found in the
name Franco, and in the Saron and Slavoniau conquesta.

In Fruere, the Franks of the Lower Rhine, and the Franks
of the Upper Rhine, met in the parts about Frooeieilomte,
and combined; the former swamping the latter, aud making
