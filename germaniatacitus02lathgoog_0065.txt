also believing that, next ιο the Gauls, the Germana them-
selves supplied the Romans with information concerning
Germany‚l consider it more likely that one of the two
should be German and native, than that either the Germans
or the Gauls should have used two synonymous designatione.

4. When the name of the nation is the same as that of
some national hero-Thus, the fact that the Greeks recog·
nized Hellen as the patriarch of their stock would, even if it
stood alone, be good reason for considering the name Hellenas

ιο which it applica, but not found in the langnrage of the
most likely informante-Ep„ Ι believe the word Ttob ιο

it contains the Norse sound of ι (ιι), asound too rareto ιο

6. When the nemeis very particular and specific-The
names that one nation gives another are mostly gaverda and
collective. They have seldom a vocabulary sufficiently foll
for the divisione and subdivisions of any family but their
own. On the other hand, a very generic and collective
power is ιὀοὶοιᾰ socie evidence of the name ιο which it is
attached not being native.

Writers, from whom it is nnsafe ιο differ—as far as they
, geon any principles at all, and exerciso any doubt whatever
upon the subject-will possibly add another characteristic of
indigenons use. They may consider that the general and
undoubted vernaculae use of a given name at one period may
be a conclusive argument in favour of its vernacular nse
originally. The natural reluctance ofa whole nation ιο take
to iteelf a designation given it by another, may be urged in
favour of this view. I submit, that this is entirely a qnes-
tion of degreez and that it depende on the relative influence
and importance of the two natione involved. The modern
name Belyt’am is, undoubtedly, anything but native, to, in
its immediate application. lt is a Roman word, in a Roman
form, and all that can be said in favour of its Belgio character
is, that the country to which it applica supplied the Latin
language with the most essential part of it. Nevertheless, it
