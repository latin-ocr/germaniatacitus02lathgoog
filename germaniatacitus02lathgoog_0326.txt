kind must we take; the extermination of the people, or the
change of namsi

The evidence in favour of the former view, is strong;
Tiberius—‘⁶ Sicambros dedentes se traduxit in Galliam atque
in proximis Rheno agris collocavit.''-Suet. Aug. 21.

Again‚— “Germanico (bello) quadraginta millia dedititi-
orum trajecit in Galliam, juxtaque ripam Rheni sedibus as·
signatis collocavit.''-ldem‚ Tib. 9.

Tiberius, speaking oi himself, says, that, “ Se novies a dive
Angusto in Germaniam missum, plura consilio qnam vi per·
fecisse3 sie Βὶοοοοινοο iu deditionem acceptos, sic Suevos.'’-
Tae. Ann. ii. 26.

A stronger expression still occurs in another place:—“ Ut
quondam Sicanvdci excisi, et in Gallias trajecti forent, ita
Silurum nomen penitus extinguendum.”-Ann. xii. 39.

On tha other hand,-

a. The name Sicoadri was probably (inilia, since we find
it in (iasar. Possilly, it was aeolosioely so; in which case,
the explanation is clear. It disappeared as soon as . the Ger·
mans, ιο which it applied, became known by their German
designatione

h. It was, perhaps, the collective name oia confederacy‚
consisting of Geyer-ai, θοοοιήοοῗί, Marsi, and others; iu
which case it became obsolete when the confederacy was
broken up.

1 do not profess ιο see my way clearly here; or ιο be
able to decide to even my own satisfaction. Neither ean I ex-
plain the relation between the names Sicambri (Su-pamla)
and Gamla-irim for Ι think it would be anacleto consider
it accidental.

Besides this, tharsis a (lemborc conspicuous as a female
