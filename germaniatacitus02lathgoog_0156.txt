entem-rho stim, is a name by which the same river is
known to both the French of its westmn, and the Germane of its
eastern bank. This is not always the case in the frontior rivers ;
since they may bear one name in one language, and another iu another.
It is far from certain that this was not the case with the Rhine
originally.

The French and Gemens know it by the same name, not because
their aucestors did, but because each has taken their appellation
from the Remans3 the word Rhenus is in the same category with
Genauam.

From whom did the Romans take itt 'I'o what ancient language
is it reserablel Almost certainly to the Keltic of (lauh in which
the Gaulo eripiam, but the Romans diffaeed the name. It might
of ocume have been German as well 3 though Ι think it unlilrely, the
original German name being probably lost. .

N either is it certain that the name litim was persistent through·
out the whole course os the river. The Lower Rhine might hare bad
one name, the Upper Rhine another, just as the Lower Danube was
called Ister, aud the Upper, Danubius. Itis not likely that tbe
Batavians of Hollaud, and the Helvetians os Switzerland gave the
same name to the very different parts of their common river. Names
of rivers only become general where there is one homogeneous popu·
lation along their whole course 3 or, what is the same thing, when a
second party perceives the unity of the whole water-system. This
was what was done by the Romans, and that is the reason sor believ-
ing that, originally, the name lettre was a partiat one

Is this term, or oue like it, applied to any other Keltic rivers, so
that there may be several Rhion in France, justas there are several
Ouses and Acone in Englandl The bearing of this question is of
importance. As the question stands at present, the word is a Keltic
gloss of no great velue, though of some. It is only a proper name.
If, however, it reappears as the designatiou of other rivers, the chauces
are that it is uo proper earne, but a mmmou tervan no word, like
Jotn or stoma, but a word like water, muer, areum. Glosses ot
this kind are more valuable than the others.

Rhea is probably the ,same root as Blucium so that libiae and
Rheae are the same word in different dialects. ube disappearance
os thed creates no difficulty. The very word Rheae, as compared
⁸ with Rhodanus, illustrates it.

It is also, probably, the same word with Brittan-ua ,· the ejection
