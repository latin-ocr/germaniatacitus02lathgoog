of the anarchos. Something of the kind has been admitted;
and Marchmen, over and above those of Ariovistus aad the
Marcomannis war, hare been recognised. But not to the
extent necessary to do away with the difficulties of the
question. The Gallie march, on the confines of Germany and
Gaul-the Slavonic march, falling into different divisione
according to the different parts of the lengthy frontier—the
Roman march, on the confines of those parts of Vindelicis,
and the Decumates Agri which acknowledged the supremacy
of the empire—and the Northem march, on the side of the
unescertained frontier of Sleswielr·Holstein-each, or any of
these, may have supplied the name Marcomanni. Ι do not
say that they all have done so. I only say that such may
have been the case. If so, how hasty it is to assume that
the Marcomannici different times and different localities are
one and the same representatives of a separate substantive
natica as trnly as Cherusci or Chamavi are— locomotive,
migratory, and well-nigh ubiquitons. No one in England
imagines that the history of the Welsh Marchmen, is that
of the Marchmen of the Scottish berder, end that the front-

No! There were as many Marchmen as Marclee, end as
many Marcles as frontiers. I <lo not, at present, say that
the Marcomanni of Ariovistus and the Marcomannici Maro·
bodnus belonged to different sections of the Germanic stock;
since what is written, at present, is meant as an illustration
rather than an argument. I only say that it is likely that
they did so—the one being the Marchmen of the Gallic, the
other the Marchmen of the Rhoete-Vindelicen, or Rhaeto-
Pannonian march; possibly as different from each other as
the retainers of the ancient lords of the marchas of Alnwick
and Ludlow respectively.

of the marches of the ancient Marcomanni coinciding with
the boundaries of different stroke, roceo, remane, or whatever
we call those great divisione of the human species which we
designate hythe terme Gothic, Slavonie, and Keltie. I say ’
