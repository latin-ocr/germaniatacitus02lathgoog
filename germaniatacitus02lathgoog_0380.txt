ὀ. Also, that they were the ‹kpovyovvht'ovee of Ptolemy.

e. Alae, the Οὖρουγούνδοι of Zosimus.

d. Also, the Bovpoeiyovvhot of Agathino.

ι. Possihly the Bolyariaae of the later historiens.

They were occupante of the parts aaa of tha Upper Vis·
tulo, or between the Vistula and Bug. They were well·
known to tha Greek writers of the Byzantina empire; and
the only question concerniug them is, whether they were
Scythiam οι Hune-Obrue δὲ ἅπαντες κοινῇ μὲν Σκύθαι καὶ
Οὕννοι ἒπωνομάζοντο· ἰδία δὲ κατὰ γένη, τὸ μέν τι αὐτῶν
Κοτρθγοοροι, τὸ δὲ Οὐτθγουροι, ἄλλοι δὲ Οὐλτίζουροι, καὶ
ἄλλοι Βουρούγοονδοι. . . αὐτίκα ’γοῦν Οὐλτίζουροί τε καὶ
Βουροθγουνδοι μέχρι μὲν Λέοντος τοῦ αὐτοκράτορος καὶ τῶν
ἐν τῷ τότε Ῥωμαίων γνώριμοί τι ὑπῆρχον καὶ ἄλκιμοι
εἶναι ἐδόκουν· ἡμεῖς δὲ οἱ νῦν οὔτε ἴσμεν αὐτοὺς, οὔτε, οἶμαι,
εἰσόμεθα, τυχὸν μὲν διαφθαρέντας, τυχὸν δέ ὡς πορρωτάτω
μεταναστάντας.-Α3δῐ11ἱ88, V. ll.

Still the similarity of the name is remarkable.

Gousidering‚ however, that their neighbonrs on the south
were the Galle of tha Danube, that the name is by no means
ιιιιιιιανίίμ native, that their country was the water-ehad of
the Vistula and Bug, and that seiryewei=hill ⁵ in Gothic, it is
hy no means unlikely that, different as were the natione, these
names may haye been the same, ι’.ι., the German form for
Hiylkzader. Still it is quite aa likely to ba accidental; and,
if the Buruytmdi of the Bug were Buhyuriane, is so.

But the difficulty does not end here. Ptolemy haelendes
his Φρονγουνδίωνες, a population called Βοογούνται.

α. The Αἰλουαίωνες (ΗοΙνοοοοοο, see note iu· voc.) lay
between the Ῥουτίκλειοι aud the Βοαγούνται.

ὂ. The Lyyie' Omuae' carne ὑπὸ τοὺς Βουγούντας.

c. Tha Bovyoelvrae came east of the Semnones, from the
river Suebus (Σοῦηὸος) to the Vistula.

These are very difficolt conditione. At first it appears that
we must separate the Βοικγούνται from the Φρονγουνδίωνες,
because Ptolemy mentions both; and that we must consider
the former to be the Buryundiaae of Franconia, because
Ptolemy dooe not mention these latter.
