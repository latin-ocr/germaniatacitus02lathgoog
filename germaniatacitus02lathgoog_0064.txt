The people of Finland eall themselves Quales. Most 01
their neighbonrs call them Fines. .

The Laplanders call themselves Salme (Seme). The Nor· ἱ
wegians call them Fines. Finmark means Lepmark.

The hill-tribes of India have no collective neme at all.
Eech tribe has 110 separate denomination. The collective
names Khoad, aaa, datr, ne, are 011 Hindn.

The Slavonians vary the name with the nation. The
Germane they call Nlemcy, the Fines Tatta.

The Germane call all Slavouians Wadi. No Slavoniau Ι
calls himself so.

This list 01 110 differenee between native and foreign
designatione might be greatly extended. The present in-
stances merely illustrate the extent 10 which the differenee

· occure.

In ancient writers we are seldom snre of the name applied
10 a given population being notice. We should rather look
for it 10 110 language of the population that supplied the
information.

From which it follows that we can rarely assume that any
name belongs to the language 01 the population to which
it applies; and this erentes 0 difficulty too often overlooked.

1 never allow myself 10 assume this indigenons origin of a
national name, except under the following circumstances:-

1. When the information conceming a nationis known to
be drawn from the 001100 110011 01 first-hand.-Thus‚ all that
00000· writes conceming the Germana I attribute to Gallie
sonroee; and, consequently, assume the names to be Gallia
also. They moy be German ae well; but this is an accident.
He may also 10 certain exceptional cases have taken the
German designation. The general rule, however, is, that
the name belongs 10 the langeage of the informante.

2. When 110 name has a meaning in the language 10
which it appion—Thus, Moreomonni is eo truly German
that, even in (laser, I believe it to be native. How 01100 11
may be safe 10 assume such a meaning is another question.

3. When the nemeis one 001 01 two or many-Bellen·
ing (aa, with many better jndges, I do) that the words
00111 and Greci are different names for tho same people‚ end
