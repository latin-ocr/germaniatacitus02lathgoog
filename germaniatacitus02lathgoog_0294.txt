l'his is much beyond the limite of the present Thuringia. More
than this, it is beyond the Τευριοχαῑμαι of Ptolemy. Ν evertheless,

probable

If so, the country of the Hermunduri was the greater part os
Thuringie, plata the valley of the Naab.

For accomplishing the change from Slaronic ιο German, the date
of the chief Alamannia conquesta is full early enough.

But it by no means follows that, becam Germaus of the Alemanuic
type conquered a country, originally Slavonic, in the third, fourth, or
