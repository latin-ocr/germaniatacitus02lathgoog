EPILEGOMENA. v

Now, the name of each of these populations gives their
localities.

a. Tre-doulos is the oldest form of the Dutch dIstrict
Tw=eute, in Overijsel.

b. Ampsiuarii :Emis-were, occupante of the (Upper) Esne.

Both seem to have been on the OlemcoFrisiou frontier
(perhaps as Murctmcn), and, consequently, it is difficolt to
give them their exact ethnological position.

That considerable displacement occurred in these parts is
certain. The annihilation of the Ampsivarii is not so.

The name reappears in the fourth century—“ Pauci ex
reparastis et chattis, Marcomere duce, in ulterioribus
collium jugis apparuere.”-Sulpic. Alex. ap. Gregor. Turon.

The Anepsioorii of Tacitus are, almost certainly, tlre Ἀμ-
ψίανοι of Strabo. Whether they are also the Καμψίανοι of
that writer is doubtful-See Epibyomeau,

ὅ. Ooaioesotea.-The locality now called Kiuheim, and
Koa-ruere in North Holland, is considered to retain the root
Ooo- of the componnd form; the power of the-final elementa
being unknown, and the evidence of the word being a com·
pound at all being, consequently, inconclusive. Such, how·
ever, it probably is.

The Oanincfates are mentioned in Hist. iv. 15, 16, 18.

They are closely connected with the Batavi ; a fact, which,
as far as it goes, is in favour of that population being native
rather than of Heraion origin-See note in vv. Salutii, and
ᾖ Batti, in Bpilcpomcoo.

A measure of the extent to which absoluto and implicit faith
isto be placed in each and every statement, of even so great
a writer as Tacitus, is to found in his account of the J owe,
whom he brings from (irate. Yet it was easier to write

correctly about the Jews, than about the populations of
Gourland, Gallicia, and Poland.

ᾗ 11. run nnn sacrans.

A doc Tarsum, Tauiana, or Tamiana is mentioned asa
local goddess of the Marsi.
