into Britain. But that, again, is to assume the point instead
of proving it. .

Some, at least, of the Belgae, were Gallie in regard to their
concitatioris-witness the Eburones, who were clonae to the
Treuiri.

The names (ag, those beginning in tre- aud cen) were
Gallio. This is an argument which the present writer, has,
at the first mew, no right to use; he has so often suggested
that a population speaking one language, might have anama
in another. In this case, however, he may do so; since
Oaesar was in the country of the Belga, and, if their names
were German, might have taken them in a German form.
Had he never crossed the Scine, it would not have been
illegitimate to argue, that Keltic names for Belgio localities
and populations, were not incompatible with aGermanic
descent for the people.

Neither is he, perhaps, justified in laying much strecs ou
the degree to which the extension of Germanic tribes to
the Seine, would diminish the Gallie population, supposed to
be so great; since he has shown but few scruples in contrast-
ing the Germanic. Still we must remember three points ·

c. First‚ that the recognition of the Belgae as German,
would subtract all the country north of the Scine, from
Gallia

b. That it would place Germane 011 the Straits of Dover,
the most probable point for the introduction of the population
of Britain into Kent, a country which we know was not
German bnt Gallio.

c. That, as the Aquitanians were Iberic, it would only
leave the parts between the Seiue and Loire for the Kelts.

In the analysis of the arguments in favour of a wide
extension of Germane into Gaul, it will generally be found—

o. That, as a general question, too much importance is
attached to the notion that common political relations
denote common ethnological ones.

b. That certain particular expressions of (laser, showing
that, iu some of the instancas before us, there were specific
signs of Gallie origin, are omitted ; ap, (lativolcus, a Belgian,

says, “ non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse.''—Bpll. Gall.
