There is a difficulty hero, which is increased by the fact of the
Danube forming but partially the RhaeteGermanic frontier. A
considerable portion ot the Rhoetia cf Tacitus reached the Danube
ae its northern limit, without, therefore, reaching the southern fron·
tier of Germany. the Decumates Agri lay north of the Danube,
between Vindelicia, Gaul, and Germany. Yet it is by no meane
certain, that the Decumates Agri were German-See not. in voc.

Perhaps a more minute investigaticn than the present writer has
had the opportunity ol making, into the early history ol the Danubian
provinces just enumerated, would account for the omission of the
names Vindelicis and Noricum, and at the same time to inform us

⁴ how the Norican population was to be distributed. 'ht—present,

however, 1 consider that Tacitus, in mentioning the Rhoeti and
Pannonii* only, recognized the alnohrpical rather than the political
division, and thought os the natural division of an area into its
nationalities rather than of the artificial distinction of provinces.

Isso, ve have an instrument cf criticism 3 since we may infer that
the Vindelici were in the same category with the Rhaeti, and that
the Norici were either Rhoetian or Pannonian, or else divided be-
tween the two.

'l'he ethnological position of the Rhaetians, the extent to which
they consisted of one or several etooks, and their relations to the
population ol Noricum, are difficult and complicated questions
N either are they true portione of Gennan ethnology.

Hence the present note vill contain little beyond the notice of
the country and its occupants in their present state.

Politically speaking, Rhaetia with Vindelicia, comprisee the fol·
leving countries and districts—l. 'the Vorarlberg. 2. The Gri-
sons, or Graubriindten. 3. 'l'heValteline 4. Tbel'eesino. 5. l'he

l'yrol. 6. Part of bombardy. 'l'hese form Rhoetia proper. The
southern part of Bavaria, the south-eastem part of Wurtemburg,
and a small portion ol Baden constitute Vindelicia.

Geographically viewed, this area embracee a portion of two water·
systema, and a water-ebed, uia, the southern feeders of the Upper
Danube, and the northern ieeders oi the Po 3 the water-ebed between
them being formed by the Alps. Besidee these the head-wetere ot*
the Rhine belong to Rhatia
