the interpretatio Romana fixed upon Woden aa the corresponding
god 10 Mercury, we do not clearly see,· but we are not acquainted
with the rites and logends which may have made this perfectly clear
to the Romans.”-Saxons in England, vol. i. 338. Other facts
deepen the shade 01 1110 difficulty. Adam 01 Bremen, in his de-
scription 01 the temple at Upsala, writes: “ Wodanem vero sculpunt
armatum, sicuti nostri Martem sculpere solent!²

N awertheless, 11 some known god must be the analogue 01 Tacitus's
Mercnry, and if-besides this—it must be his ottcihates that deter-
mine the correspondence. Wodsn’s claim—as aforesaid-is tho best.

But another series 01 facts make it possible that the correspond-
ence was determincd less by the attribuas than the acme.

In moro 1100 one 01 the Gothic languages we have 0 dialogue in
which one 01 110 interlocutors is Solonion. Solomon exhibita his
wisdom in a series of answers put to him by agibing ironist-who, in
the AngloSaxon dialogue, is called Saturum, but in several 01110
French ones Marcus, 110 fuller and older form 01 which is Maronis.
Mr. Komble, in his edition 01 110 AngloSaxon work for the AElfric
Socisty, has given elaborate reasons for beliewing that 110 Marcolf is
Saturnus, and cicc wad. The sort 01 fiction is a common one.
Shrewd common-sense on one side, wiewing 011 things in a practical
light, and tincturing all things with 0 caustio irony, is brought 1010
collision with the higher wisdom of a true sago ; and, upon tho
ground 010 1001 being able tc ask more questions in an hour than 0
wisc man can answer in a day, succeeds in puzaling tho higher wis·
dom 01 110 opponent.

Now Marcols is a German name 3 and although tho Marcols 01
the dialogue may have grown 00101 110 Mercarim 01 110 (llnssics,
alter being introduced on German ground, he moy also have had an
independent origin, and hare been German from the beginning.

Il so, this origin may have been as old as the time 01 Tacitus, so
that that writer’s analogue of his own Meroury may haro been what,

subsequently, became Marcols or Marcone-the emme being like, and
the attributes not unlike.

Again-there is another view which may be 10100.

The rensoning which has applied to the German analogue 01 Mors
may, possibly, apply hore also. There may have been a acme similar
to the Greek Ermes .· 10 which case the process ofa Classical writer

would be, first 10 identiFy the deity with a Greek god, and then 1ο
give the result in a Latin denominativa
