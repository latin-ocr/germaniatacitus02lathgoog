Nor Kottis or Gallio, like a Gaul from the parts about
Marseilles.

Nor yet lberto, like a Spaniard.

Nevertheless, he was referable to some great eluas.

ln many cases I believe thia class to have been deemed
Gemma, purely on some such negative traius of reaeoning
as the precediug3 for instance :-I imagine that certain
deffereete'oe between the Bastarnae on one side, aud the Sar·
metiens, Thracians, Galata, and lllyriaus on the other, made
them pass as Germane, in the eyes of such inquiriug but
imperfectly informed Greeks, as knew that there was an
etbnological class called German, without kuowing accurately
what it was. Such a process, mutatis mutandae, is by no
means uncommon, even in modern investigatione. Ethnology,
even in the hands of Priohard, bas ita class called Allwlyliuo,

It ie sese, too, t'o say that the Greeks were euch authorities

palpable, they were rarely contradicted. Something of this
sort is to be found in the intellectual relations between
Englund and Germeny at the present moment. How many
points are there in euch a question, as (ap.) the ethnology of
British India, where the English iuquirer, although trustiug
to himself for particulare lyiug within the pale of a well·
known area, puts his faith iu some German for the more
general questions that ariae, as well as for those results iu
which book-learning aud speculation take a parti And
bow often is he wrong iu doing so?

According to thie view, both the Greek aud the Roman
evidence respecting Germauy fall into two parts :—

1. The Greeks-

a. Where they followed the Romana, the only first-hand
inquirere, are accurate aud trustworthy. But then their
evidence is often either superfluous, or else only confirmatory
of what we learu from Gaesar and Tacitus. .

b. Where their information is not of Roman origin, they are
indistinct and inaccurate-indistinct and inaccurate, for the
