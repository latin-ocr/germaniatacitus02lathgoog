At what time the name first became au nusquivocal
geographica] designation* of what now, iu the way of politica,
coincides with the Grand Duchy of Badeu and part of Wur-
temburg, aud, in respect to its physical geography, is part of the
Black Forest, is uncertain. It was unt, however, later thau
the reign of Alexander Severus (ending nn. ram-the Ta-
bula Peutingeriana being supposed to be referable to that
date. Thereiu, Aususnnrs aud Suavra appear together—
as terma for that part of Genuany which had previously
gone under the name of Dammae agri, aud the parts about
the mma Romanas.

With this, then, begins the history of the Saevi of ιῗυαόὁα,
or, rather, of the Scabiosa. Their alliances were chiefly
with the Alamanni and Burgundians3 their theatre the Ger-
man side of Franco, Switzerland, Italy, and (iu conjunctiou
with the Visigoths) Spain. Their epoch is from the reign
of Alexander to that of Augustulus, in round numbers, from
about nn. 225 to nm. 475, aperiod of two hundred and
fifty years.

Their monium amount of historica] promiueuoo was tho
time when Ricimer the Senon, aud Gundobald the Barpan-
(ἡαπ, made and unmade such emperors as Severus and Oly·
brius, the immediate predecessore of Augustulus.

Now is the time to take a measure of the extent to which
the notion† that Saco- was ao carta Gonnos tem ot all,
dat o Kallia come adopted by tle Romana is a paradox, or
a probable infereuce from the early notices of the populations
sccalled.

1. It is not a question whether the root Saso· was Keltic
or not. It is known to have been so.

2. Nor is there maol doubt about its haring been from
the Gaulo that the Romans took it: since it was probably
Gaulo from whom Caesar learned tho names of the allisa and
subjecte of Ariovistus.

ἵ Niebuhr mentions an inscription noticiug a Victoria Samira iu the
reign of Nerva. But there is no evidence of this having been a victory
orer the Sacri of Snotia. Coeser's victory orer the Saevi of Ariovistus was
a Victoria Sasona, but no victory over the people ol the Decumates agri.
