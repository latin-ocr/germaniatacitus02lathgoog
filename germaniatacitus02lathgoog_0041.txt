erroneons, or has subsequent change taken placet No general t
answer cau be given to the question. It depende upon the 1
credibility of the author on the one side, and the likelihood ¹,
of the changes assumed, anthe other. If the changes are pro· ι ,,
bable and the author nnexceptionable‚ the decision is in favour ‘
of the change. If the author, however, be exceptionable aud ⁸·
the changes such as have never been previously known, the '

converse is the case. Between these extremes there is every “ ³,

μ intermediate degree. The changes may be of average magni·
tude, and the author of medium credibility. All this, how-
ever, merely shows that the balance between the conflicting
difficulties is easily struck in some cases,that insama it is
difficult, and in others almost impossible.

Iam not, just at present, prepared ιο decide upon the
particular case in hand, or to determine whether Tacitus has
been, at one and the same time, accurate in all his state-
ments, and rightly interpreted by his commentatore, or
whether he has not confounded Slavonians and Lithuanians
with Germane. This will come in due time; at present it
is sufficient to take an exception against the uncritical spirit
in which his evidence hae been treated. Two distinctions of
paramount importance have been neglected.

l. The cetera to which hie statements are at variance with
the first leswe stete ef celeps subseqneut to his time, bas
been overlooked.

2. The value of his evidence for the, parts which could
only be known, to even his best informante, by hearsay only,
hes been placed on the same level with the velue of his
evidence respecting the parts personally known to his cou-
temporarios.

How different, for instance, were his means of describing a
Frisian or a Oheruscan, from bis date for Poland and Silesia.
Yet Poland and Silesia are parts of the (lemmata of Tacitue,
and Friesland and Osnabnrg are no more. The legionary of
Drusus or Tiberius might describe, from persona] knowledge,
the populations of Eme, orWeser3 but, whoever described the
tribes of the Oder or Vistula, would describe them from hear-
eay accounts‚—hearsay accounts, which Ι baveno wish ιο
undervalna-hearsay accounts which can often be satisfac·
