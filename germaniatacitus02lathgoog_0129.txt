his absence, few important events occurred, except that the
Bructeri defeated the legate, M. Lollius, destroyed his legion,
aud captured the standards. After the return of Tiberius,
he received the command iu Gaul, to complete the subju-
gation of Germany; he penetrated as far as tlre Elbe, aud
reduced the Sigambri, Bructeri, and Cherusci, to obedieuce.
011 the Elbe, he was joined bytho Roman fleet, which had
been fitted out on the river Ems, or had come froin the
Rhine to the Erus. How it got up the Elbe cannot be ex·
plaiued; it may have gone up as sar as Magdeburg; and
yet the Roman galleys could not sail against the current,
like etcum-beata. After this campaign, Tiberius left Ger·
many, es his predecessors had done, and as many of his
successore did after him; for the intention of the Romans
was merely to crush the Germana, not to put themselves
iu possession of their country, which they cau hardly have
thought worth the trouble of occupying.

While the Germano, north of the Thi‘rringer Wald and
about the Hara Mountaius, were thus visited by the Romans,
there existed iu Bohemia the great kingdom of Maroboduus,
who is a strange and mysterious phenomeuon iu the early
history of Germauy. It is expressly stated that he had
a large town (Reviesmum) for his capital, a regular army
oi seventy thousand men, and four thousand horsemen, a
body-guard, and definite political institutione. Justus Mdser
is perfectly right iu saying that the Germana, iu the descrip-
tious of the Romans, must not be conceived of as more un·
civilized than the modern peasants of Westphalia, or Lower
Saxony. 'l'heir dwellinghouses, one thousand eight hundred
years ago, were, I believe, not different from the more com-
mon ones in our own days, aud the habitatione of their
chiefs were the same as the buildings of the middle ages.
The notion that the ancient Gemens were savages is com·
pletely salse; they were neither more nor less than uncul·
tivated country-people, to whom life in towns is altogether
unknown.

Venautius Fortunatus, in his poem to Radaguuda, speaks
of the rnined magnificence of her father's empire, and the
bressenvered palaces of her aucestors. the kings of Thiiringia.
