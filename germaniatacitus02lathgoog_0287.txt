In favour of a Slavonic affinity are :-

1. Their Slavonic character at the time they were first described
from personal knowledge.

2. The absence of any traces ofa previous Germanic population in
the area occupied by them.

the Warnswi were Slavonic, whilst the belief that the Varini were
German, is a reasonable, but not unexoeptionable, inlerenoe.

Probably, they were a frontier population.

Ptolemy’s list, isthat of the Φουνδοΰσιοι. Here Ptolemy is wrong and
