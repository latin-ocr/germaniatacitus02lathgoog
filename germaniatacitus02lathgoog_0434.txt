mentions both Teutones and Tanton-orii (Teutono-soora) with
the Vinwsi between the Soccus and Saevi.

This places them in the parts about the Elbo.

Ptolemy's names, l imagine, are, like the Chatti ol Esses
’ and Oderit-sarii, names of one and the same people.

Hence, it seems sale to essert-that there were Teutone on
the Lower Elbe, near enough to the Germane to have a Ger·
man compound, ae their name— Tanton-urii= Teutonowcro. ¹

Whether they were Germane is another question. They
may have been Germana of the Germano-Slavonic March in
Luneburg‚ or Mecklenburg.

In the history of ethnologieal opinion these Teutonos hare a
prominent place. They cannot but have been identified with
the Teutones of the OimbroTeutonic war-with migratione
to match.

Yet the chief reason which makes the Teutones of Marius
look like Germana is the fact that most militates against
our identifying them with the Teutones of Ptolemy.

Diot=poophr so that it is a common rather than apropor
name; and, as such, a name which may be applied to any
population which chooses to call itselfpceph, mco, or notiora.

Now natione may do this independently of ethnological
affinity.

But this is overlooked; auditis overlooked because the
impossibility of Dost·sol=Tout-oo‚ has never been thoroughly
acted upon.

The root L-t=peopls in German (Lastc); yet uo one
argues that the Latina, Litbuouiwas, and a host of other
populations must, for that reason, be German

The root V·ly=people in Latin (only-us), yet no one gives
this as a reason for making the Bady-c Romans.

Fer, too, does the sama in German. But is thie areaaon
for snapping·up every nation whose name is Voles, Belga,
or something like it, as German? If so, the Volcae Tecto·
sagos would be Germans.

Why, then, apply a rule to the root T·t=pooplc which we
apply to no other combinationes sounds with a similar powerl
Because, the impossibility alluded to hae never been truly
realizcd in the mind ol the inquiror, and men argue about
