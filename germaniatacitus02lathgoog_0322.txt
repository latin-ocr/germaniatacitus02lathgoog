since the languagee were wholly unknown, and the evidence they
supplied unappreciated.

llenoe the test was less retined. As a consequence 11 this, what
wc 1111 191111 was, in 1111 time of Tacitus, partly 11111 and partly
Sitowiara.

1. The first was the name where the physical conformation was
that 11 the lappae people 1ο whom, at the present moment, the
term 1111 11 limited by the Scandiuawians 11 Norway and Sweden.

2. The second was 11111 where the physical conformation was not
much different from that 11 the Germans3 and it comprised (probably
with many other sections) the Qooens or Tinlanders—whose bullr
⁸and physical strength is by no means, palpably and contrastedly,
1111111111 that 111111 Swedes‚ Russians, and Lithuauiana. 01 these
the Sitones (or Qwaens 11 Tinland) were the chief. Tacitus makes
them saeve ; by Sacrae probably (but not indisputably) meaning
Soricaria.

Now the separation 11 what wc now called Ugrians into the
Sitouians and 11111 1111 reality, the natural inferenoe from the
remarkable contrast between the Ugrians 11 the Iapp type, and the
Ugrians 11 the Finlandic 3 a difference which exista at the present
moment as strongly as ever it could have done in the time 11
Tacitus, a difference, too, which, ewen in the present days 11 ethno-
logioal classifioation, has been 11111 1111111111. Hence, the separa·
tiones the Sitones from the 11111 11 11 argument against the
1111111 being Tinlanders, ia, Qvoeas, properly so called, 11111 11
11111111, improperly. It is just such 1 separation as many an
ethnologist would make now. The difference which it is most
important 11 remember is that between the words stn and 1111
os acmes-a difference which soe 11 England draw less definitely
than did Tacitus, or, at least, Tacitus’s informauts.

⁴ Hellusios et Oscensi-Upon the latter 11 these names I can
throw but little light On the former I can only remark the resem-

blance 11 their name 11 Ptolemy’s river walnas (111λοῦ111 πόταμος)

and the Chali (Χάλοι).
But these arc in the parts about the Lower lllbe, or the rivers 11

Mechlenburg, or the Tydeu or, perhaps, the Trave,· to the last 11
which the assectarum has been supposed 1ο apply. Still, they
may be the parta to which Tacitus refers, notwithstanding the 1111
