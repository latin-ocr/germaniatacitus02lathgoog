⁷ Treoisi]-l'he lower third of the Moselle may be taken as the
area of the Treviri; extending (there or thereabouts) from {freres
(deputem Trevirorum) to Ooblentz (Confluentes).

The chief nations with which they were conterminous on the
side of Gaul were the Condrusi, Eburones, and Remi—all Bclyoe.

une Treviri, like the Tencteri, were pre-eminently strong in
cavalry—(lesan Bell. Gall. ii. 24, v. 3.

They were also but slowly conquered.-“ Treviri liberi antea,” bc.
-Plin iv. 17.

'Phe name Treviri is most probably Gallie. 'dhe Tre, is the rte
in such words as Tre-caeses in ancient Gaul, and Treponelt in Gorn-
wall 3 the Keltic tre=pleee, a root exceedingly common in Keltic

The language of the Tre-oiri is important.

In meet cases it would be hypercritieal ιο suppose that there
was any difference between the language of the town of Preces and
the language of the Treviri ln the present question, however, itis

referresi aliqua exinde corruperint; quum et Afri Phoenicum lin-
guam nonnulla ex parte mutaverint 3 et ipea Latinitas et regionibus

[think that this language was that of the Tolistobois', Treceni, and
Tectosopoe, te, of those Galate who gave their name to Galatia

Niebuhr, however, denies that it was Galatian that St Jerome

haard3 and, aster noticing the campaign of the Romans against
them, he adds in a note that “Stderome says that be heard
