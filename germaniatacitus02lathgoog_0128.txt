the Romans, who adranced ns far as the westward‚ though
they did not make any conquesta. In 740 the Romans
attached the Germane both on the Danube and on the Lower
Rhine. The fact that such attacks were never made on the
Upper lanino, as far down as the river Lahm shows that
Suabia was not theu a German country; it did not become
one until the Alemanni settled there. All we know about
this war ievagne and indefinite, and the account iu Dion
cassius is unfortunately mutilated. It may hare been in
these campaigns that, as my friend Roth conjectures, Domi-
tius Ahenobarbus penetrated into Germany across the Elbe
in Bohemia; for, in the subsequent invasione, we mostly find
the Romans marching towards the Elbo from the Lower
Rhiue. Tho war was conducted by 'liberius' younger
brother, Nero Claudius Drusus, in three campaigns. He
advanced from the Lower Rhiue across the Weser‚ ae far as
the Elhe, and subdued the Bructeri, Sigambri (who were
then very renowned), Cherusci, and other tribes. The
details of his campaign are not known and localities are
scarcely ever mentioned. Since the Germane had no towns,
their only protection was the impassable natura of their
country, for they had no fortified places; and, when they
met the Romans in the open field, they were usually beaten,
being unable tc resist the military skill of the Romane.
Their country was now ravaged3 women and children were
carfied off into slavery, and the men were put to death like
wild beasts3 for, although Drusus was otherwise of a mild
disposition, cousidering what the Romans then were, yet he

Δ was, like Varus. a great sinner (ἀλιτήριος) towards the

Germane. He died in his camp, not without a suspicion
of Tiberius haring caused his death; but this may have been
believed only ou account of the hatred which Tiberius enter·
tained against tha family of his brother, especially against
Germanicus. All that Tiberius could have leared was, that
Drusus, like Germanicus, might indulge iu the fair dream of
restoring the republic.

Iu 745, after the death of Drusus, Tiberius took the
command; aud his triumph over the Germane was followed

by his withdrawal to Rhodes. During the maen years of
