Ecooiooaia.

Tattenos-In the way of evidence of there being Teutones
amongst the Germane, over and above the associate mention
of their names with that of the Oimbri, there is but little.
They are not so mentioned either by Tacitus or Strabo.
Ptolemy, however, mentions α) the Teutonarii, d) the Teutones:
Τευτονοάριοι καὶ Οὐίρουνοι-Φαραδεινῶν δὲ καὶ soleae,
Τεύτονες καὶ Ἄμαρποι. Besidee this, however, arguments
have been taken from o) the meaning of the rout teut=pcople
(biuda, Moeso-Gothic; baed, AnglcSaxom diot, Old High
German: ὂ) the saltem Tootodergc‘oa: c) the supposed con-
nection of the present word Dect-selr=Germoo with the
classica] word Tem-orrea. These may briefly be disposed of.

a.) Itis not unlihely for an invading nation to call them·
selves tle action, tle notiores, tle propte, bc. Neither, if the
tribe in question hed done so (presuming them te have been
Germane or Gothu), would the word employed be very unlike
Pontou-ea Although the word biodu=octioa or μυρία, is
generally strong in its declension (so making the plural biod-
6³), it is found also in a weak form with its plural thiel-rim
Τηίων. See Deutsche Grammatik, i. 630.

ὂ.) The soltus Teutoborgiua mentioned by Tacitus (Anu. i.
60) can scarcely have taken ite name frome tribe, or, on the
other hand, have given it to one. It means either rto tiu of
tle peoplo, or tle city of tle μορίω according as the syllable
dorg- is derived from doirgs=o till, or from tatrys=o city.
ln either case the compound is allowable, ag. dict-rodo, pellic
