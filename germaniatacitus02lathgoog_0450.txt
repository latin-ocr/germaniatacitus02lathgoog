one. Hence l put the accounts of Jornandes low; because
they are just the accounts which the existing state of things
would call for-just as, Ι imagirle, that the similar relations ol
the lsla of Wight population, the Augias, and the Saxone, did
with Beda. Yet Ι put what may bs called tha pluri-presence
of a population called D-rr (or Dc), in geographical contact
with a population called (ι’-ί, high; and admit it to he the
best reason existing in favour of the deductiori of ths Daci
and aare from the Baltic.

Yet it is not conclusive. Names may bs what is con·
veniantly called correlative. Thus :-

α. Let D·a=couatmorr, and Ga, a mors of lle interior
συμπίῃ (or oica wad) ς or·-

b. Lot Du=mourvtoirsccn and sst=lowlundsr (or cios
ewedh or-

o. Let Dor=aatioa and sst=sorcipcsr (or vioe carad).

Casas of this sort may easily bs multiplied. Any one of
them, however, shows that, wherevcr certain physical or
wcial conditione involving the correlation in question occurs,
corresponding names may occur alsa-and that, independent
of any descent or migration

Ι do not say that this was the case in the present instanee;
having no little of evidence to support its application to the
case before us. Ι only say that such an hypothesis ia good
against the assumption of any equally gratuitous migration.

This is complementary to the note in v. Cherusci.

Caesar mentions the samar, as forming a part of the
army of Ariovistum and ha is the first author who mentions
them at alh-but says nothing about the Cherusci.

Tacitus mentions tha Cherusci, but not the Harudes.

The Marmor Ancyranum has the form Ollarudcs.

The change from Ot- to H· (and uice wau) has osten been
mentioned already,-Ollutti= Hesus, Oiatlwrii=chzourii

Foun for form, I think Harud- is the root of tha word
Olor-usui.
