01 these two elemento that ol camber was the first to become
obsoleto, so that tithings cameto contsin more or less thnn 100, as
the ease might be The second, that of neighbourhood and locality,
exists at tho present time. ,

ln the ementry, it would be the aree which would have the

greater tendency to romain fixed and permanent as the character·
istic element of tho tithing and hundred3 in ιοιοοιο it would be the
number ο1 individuale.

Hence, in tho tenth century we find the following account ο1 the
erumpet equivalent ιο the hundred :—“ This is the ordinante which
the bishops and the reeves belonging to London have obtained, and
confirmed with pledges, among our frillyylda, as well corliah ss
oeorlhlt, in addition to the doomes which were fixed at Grestley, at
Exoter, and at Thundersfield.

“ Resolved : that we count every ten men together,and the chief one
to direct the nine in each ο1 those duties which we have all ordained,
and afterwards the hyndens of them together, and one hynden man
who shall admonish the teri for our common benefit; and let these
eleven hold the money of the hynden, and decide that they shnll
dishurae, when aughtis to pay, and what they shall receive, should
money accrue ιο us at our common suit. . . .

“ 'l'hat we gether to us once in every mouth, if we can, and have
leisnre, the hyndenmen, and those who direct the ottinga, as well
with butt-filling, or as else may plenae us, and know what of our
agreement has hoen executed And let these twelve'men have their
relection together, and foed themselves as they themselves think
right, and deol the remains ο1 the mesl for love of God.”

Upon this, the writer from whom the notice is tehen, con-
tinues : “As this valuable record mentions also territorial tithings,
containing different amounts ο1 population, it seems to me ιο furnich
important confirmation of the conclusion that the yeyyldon ο1 Ini
and AElfred, the members of the London tithings or frillgylds of ten,
and the York tesmontole, are in truth identieal. And it is further
in favour ο1 this view that the citizens called the memhers of such
gildadips, yeqyldcn :-

“ And we have also ordained‚ respecting every man who hns given
his pledge in our gyldships, that should he die, each gyld-hrother
(gegylda) shall give a gesnsel-loaf for his soul, end sing a fifty
(psalmo), or cause the same ιο be sung within xxx days? -Ju-
