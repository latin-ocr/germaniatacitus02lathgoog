suae parochiae, ultimam scilicet partem saxonie, quae eat trans
Albiam et dicitur Nordalbiugia‚ continens tres populos, Tott-
’ marsos, Helonius, Stormorios.’'—Helmold. Chron. Slavor. i. 6.
“Attrita suut vires Saxonum, et servierunt Orneoui sub tributo,
omnis terra videlicet Nurdulbiugorum, quae disterminatur iu
tres populos: Holzntos, saumarios, Tlotmurclos.”--Id. i. 26.

This means the θσνιηαπε uf Holsteiu, Stormar, aud Dit-
mareh; but whether they were Sanora, strictly speaking,
is uncertain.

The prnont populatiou is Platt-Deutsch; but the intro·
duction of this is subsequent to the niuth century.

The populationes which it eucroached was North Frisium
and this, Ι believe, to have been what was called the Nor-dul
linqiun Sanun—See note iu v. Frisii.

l believe thieto be a Genuau modificationes the Tshekh
(Bohemian or Moruvisn) name of the eortina· the Tenet
modification having changed the Gtu J, and the German the
tto tl. Besides which, it replaced the inflectional clement
·n- by the affix -unq,· as was the case iu the word Palal-
inqna= Slavoniaus of the Elbo (Ladu); where po is Slavonic,
Lala, Slavonic, and ·inq· German.

The form Vilcnsqi occurs=Jutlnnqi Now these aud
similar varieties* should remove all difficulties on the score
ofa word taking such different shepes as Jntae, Jnthanqi,
Gentes, Gothi, Gothini, thhones, Gotones, Gonia, Vita,
Vntnnqi, (ἴσως since the following varieties of an equally
simple root are as numerous. The Bulgarians appear as
Buiq, Burq, Borq, Burnq, Wnrnq, Wurq, Vulq‚ Beier, Bqler,
Bilers, Beer, Beira Similar instances could be multiplied;
but this is oue where the languages through which the form
pasees are the same, ia, Slavonic, German, Latin, and
Greek.

These varieties of form not ouly cause no difficulty,
hut they supply a confirmation. The uusteadiuess of power
in the case of the consonant G, is what is expected n priori,

ὓ We find Vnae=Jarae.
