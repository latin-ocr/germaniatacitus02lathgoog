b. The probably Slavonic Varini worshipped in the lsle of
Rugen.

o. The hely ishrud of Tacitus is that of the Angli—

d. With whom the Varini are inaccurately associated-

ο. The source of the inaccuraoy lying in the lact of thet
nation having a tuly lotrad, different from that of the Anglae,
but not known to he so.

Now the passages that prove the Varini to hare frequented
the lsle of Rugen, prove something more. They prove their
paganism. They prove, also, that some part of them were
occupante of an island 2—“Est antem insula quadam, non
longe a civitate illa, habens mare interjectum, quasi itinere
unius dici, Verania nomine.”-—“ Intellexit ergo vir Dei, Vero·
nos evangelica gratiae indignos.''-“ Erant autem trans
mare barbari crudelitate et ssevitia singulares, q'ui Verani
dicebantur.''-—Vit. Otton. Episcopi Boll. J ul.‚ pp. 412, 413,
444.

Further still-and this bears on the ethnology of the
Rupit-although it has been shown (Prolepomeua p. xix.)
that the -9-, in the name of the Isle of Royan, appears as early
as the use of the word Itupiaoi in Helmoldus‚ the equivalent
forms Rani and uuae (without the 9) must be remarlred.
Now this omission of the p· is exemplified hy a vast variety
of other forms, ey„ Bactri, Ruunt, Regnat, Itala, Rujc, ana,
Baiana, and others, to be found in Zeuss (p. 665).

What is the effect of this? lt subtracts from the likelihood
of the Rugii of Tacitus being the Ruyiaai of the lsle of
Rupere, and, pro tuoto, favours the infereuce drawn srom their
juxtaposition to the Lemouii, or the notion that they are the
populations of the Gulf of Ripa—See nott. in vv. Rapit and
Lemouii.

The Varini, then, are not to be considered Aegle.

2. The Anione, whether oth· or Ohcciorrcs (see &plepem
§ otti), are a population of which we know nothing that
helps the present question. If identical with the nation bear-
iuga similar name, further south, they must have effecteda
migration. Upon the principle of not making this longer
than is needful‚ we must place them south of the Angli, rather
than north. Now this southern locality¹ thus assumed, is a
