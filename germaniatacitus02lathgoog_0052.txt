Resides the Classical and Gothic, there are five other stochs
in Europe; or, changing the expression, the whole indigenam
population of Europe may be thrown into seven groups.
Three of these have already been mentioned-the Gothic, the
Sarmatian, the Classical.

The foartll, the Kellia, comprises the ancient Gauls of
Gallia, and the ancient Britons of England, as well as the
present Bretons os Brittauy‚ Welsh of wales, Mauxmen ol
the lsle of Man, and Gaels ol' Ireland and Scotland.

The Ugrians, or Pinus, make the fiflb group3 aud a large

landers, and Esthonians.

The Basques of the Pyrenaea, the only remnants of theold

It is not enough to know how a cadem writer clasoifiee
the varieties of his species. The reader of Tacitus must try
to ascertain the view that the accim took of them. We
must not be surprised to lind it less scientific than our own.

Of the Classical stock they had a clear notion; ia, they
put at its full value the differences between the group to which
they themselves belonged, and the groups to which the so
called Barbaricas belonged. But this notiou was clear in
one direction only. It only comprehended the points os
difference. The resemblances which brought the Slavonians
and Gotho into the same group with themselves—the group
called Indo-European-were unknown.

Between a Goth, a Kelt, and a Sarmatian, in their more
extreme forms, they also drew a clear distinction3 although
