The reasons for the existence of a Lithuanic population in
Scandinavia‚ lie chiefly in the facts which it will account
for. But this requires us to be sure that there ie no other
alternative.

If the existence of a Germanic population will uot account
for the presence of the form Gt (with its varieties) in Scan·
dinavia, what populetion willl

The only two that 'present themselves for consideration,
are the Finn, and the Lithuanic.

The fact of tbe root in question being known to be Lithu-
auic, and not known to be Pinnio, is prinsd faeie in favour
of the former.

The Lithuanian is the only known family of which it ’
can be said that at, as the name of one of its members,
in the mouth ofa German would be likeliest of all known
names.

The only word that can be set up against it Euste=AEstii,
that being the only known German name applied to a
Lithuanian nation.

But as Boste=euetem it could apply to eastern localities
only; not to any in scandinavia.

This leaves Gr as the only known name applicabis.

Reasons for its being the one actually applied, are,—

a. It was, besides being the native, the diaconio neme as
well.

h. It was from the Slavonians that the Scandinaviau
Germana were likely to take the name of a population, between
whom and themselves the Slavonians lay intermediate.

c. Lastly‚ to certain of the Lithuanians ou the soatl of the
Baltic, a compound of the root in question actually was ap·
plied - East from Poland is Rois-poro-land-“ En austr fra
Polena er Reid-gotalrandss'- Fragment from the Fornaldar
Sbgur. (Zeuss, p. 500).

The Lithuanians then, south ol the Baltic, are called by
the ancestors of the present Danas, Swedes, and Norwegians,
at. Surely, the same name, applied by the same people on
the aortl of the Baltic, is likely to have been applied to
Lithuanians also.

ΙΙΙ. What applies to the Goths of Gothland, applies also
