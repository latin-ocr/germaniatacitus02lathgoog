some notable points of contraat. Deest-acte as a name for Geminos,
in the sense in which it occurs in the aiath century, was an impos
sibility in the first, or mamad. This is not sufficiently considered.
Many believe that the Peut, in Tesstoses, is the dact, in deut-seia
Το be this eaacdy is impossible. Any German tribe that called
itsels peuda, Dios, or θεοῦ in the first century must have givena
different meaning to tbe word ; and, so doing, have called them·

This is to prepare the reader ior some further criticism, which
will occur in thesequel.

Allemagne and Lamagna are merely modemized forms of the
name of a particular sectiones the Germana, the Alcameni

'Phe English name, as already stated, is a translation of the
Roman one.

who afterwards called themselves Deatacbc; and &maasia is tba
Roman equivalent ιο Deutschlond ,· whilst &meon and Gerusoay are
English forms of the Roman designation.

Ιι by no means, however, follows, that becaum tbe Romans called
a certain people by a certain name, that that name was Rmracn ,ν
although reasons have been given* for considering that it is the
Latin word gerasam.

I believe, sor my own part, that the word was Keltic 3 in other
words, that whilst the Germana themselves had no collective name
at all, the Romans called them what they were called by the Gaulo.
The meaning of this Gallie designation is a matter of legitimate
speculation. At present, it is sufficient to fix the langnage in which
the etymology is ιο be songht.

The date of the first mention of the name German is more curione
than important. Α distinction, however, connected with the inves-
tigation of it is necessary.

'l'he earliest date assigned to an event in German history is one
thing 3 the earliest historiari who mentions such an event is another.
A very early erent may bo recorded by a very late historian.

rl'he word cenedensium was applied ιο the natans who, as early
as tho second Carthaginien war, came across Hannibal in his passage .
cf the Alpa But, early as this is for the fact itself, the historian
who recorda it is late-Livy.
