The only doubt is about its being melesiosly Keltic, ia,
not German.

The reason in favour of this view are, perhaps, all referable
to one head, eia, the facts which the hypothesis will account
for. ef these the chief are-

l. The geswolily of the term, as seen by the express
evidence of Tacitus himself.

2. The equally express evidence of Tacitus to the fact of
a general or common name for the Germane being reserem
and of that name being Gerasam-not Sicci.

3. The difficulty of making it apply to any great divisione
of the Germanic stock. For such, we have already, in the
names lugeamus, Istaevones, and Herminones, more than we
can easily deal with.

4. The non-mentiones the name clam in Cesar, combined
the high probability of some, at least, of Gasar's Saevi having
belonged to that branch.

5. The fact of Tacitus, who places the cleta in Oaesar’s
locality of the Suevi, placing lhe Suevi to the east of it.

6. The difficulty of accounting for this by means cf a
migration. Thcugh caat has no mention of the chatti,
and Tacitus bas, it is not Tacitus who first notices them.
Tbe name appears in Strabo. Hence, ii there were a real
bodily change of locality on the part of tbe Saevi, thus ·
supposed to have been driven eastwards by the Chatti, the
displacement must have occurred between the time of (iasar
and Strabo, ia, between the time of Julius and Angustus
Cesar-and that without either the Romans of Gaul or the
Germane noticing it.

However, what a migration will aot explain, tbe assump-
tion of the word Saevi being a synonym to some of the
previous names scili. Saevi may mean obsti. Soreoi may

mean Hermunduri, or it may (as I believe it does) penially
coincide with belle.

But what explains the synonymi Nothing better than tbe
existence of a second language, especially when that second
langnage is no fiction, bnt a reality.

What lies against thisi iwill put the only strong argu-
mentun this side of the question in its strougest form. From
