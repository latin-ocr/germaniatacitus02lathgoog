Such is the evidence of those writers, Greek or Roman, who
deal with the local habitation of the Cimbri rather than with
the general history of that tribe. As a measure of the inde·
finitnde of their ideas, we have the confusion, already noticed,
between the Cimbri and Cimmerii, on the parts of Diodorus,
Strabo and Plutarch. A better measure occurs in the follow-
ing extract from Pliny, who not only lixas the Cimbri in three
places at once, butalso (as far as we can find any meaning in
his langnage) removes thern so far northward as Norway:
“ Alterum genus Ingaevonesr quorum pars Cimbri, Teutonico
Chaucorum gentes. Proximi Rheno Istoevones3 querum pars
Cimbri mediterranei.'’-iv. 28. “Promontorium Cimbrorum
excurrens in maria longe peninsulam efficit, qua Cartris appel·
latur.”-Ibid. 27. ‘⁴ Sevo Mens (the mountain-chains of Nor-
way) immanem ad Cimbrorum usque promontorium efficit
sinum, qui Codanus vocatur, refertus insulis, quarum clarissima
Scandinavia est, incomperta magnitudinis.”-lbid. Upon
conhrsion like this it is not considered necessary tc expend
further evidence. So lew statements minoida, that under
all views there must be a misconception somewhere3 and of
such misconception great must the amount be, to become
more improbable than a national migration from Jutland to
Over and above, however, this particular question of evi-
dence, there stands a second one; niz. the determination of
the ethnograpbical relations of the nations under considera·
tion. This is the point as to whether the Cimbri conquered
by Marius were Celts or Cutha, akin to the Gauls, or ahin tc
the Cermans3 a disputed point, and one which, for its own
sake only, were worth discussing, even at the expense of raising
a wholly independent question. Such, however, it is not. If
the Cimbri were Kelts, the improbability of their originating
in the Cimbric Chersonese would be increased, and with it the
amount of evidence required; since, laying aside other consi·
derations, the natural unlilrelihood of a large area being tra-
versed by a mass of emigrants is greatly enhanced by the fact
