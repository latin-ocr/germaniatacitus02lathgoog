'l'his even seems too much-tc say nothing about the difficulty
attached to the words sacher man’s follow. What could aucha

previous owner. Not for a green crop 3 since there were none such

harvest, which, in some ports, cf Englsnd, is worth from two ιο

this.

l think that the sentence of Tacitus has so little ιο do with the
mure ol land οι all, that it must be taken with what follows rather
tbsn with what pmedes3 in which case it applies ιο the hasbondty
only-not to the laws of lauded property.

Nothing but com was grown. ubis was new to an Italian: who

we approach ο solution.

We are, then, οι liberty ιο consideran occupation which is st one

eren then, the details are remarkable. Was the occupatio per vices,
