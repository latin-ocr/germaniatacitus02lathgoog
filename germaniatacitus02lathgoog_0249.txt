say that Herse came from Claui is like saying thet wasser came from

Admitting this, we gain something more than a barren fact. We
inser that, in the particular case of the (lhatti, at least, the authori·
ties of Tacitus were Low Germans3 a view confirmed not only by
the o priori probabilities of the case, but by several other similar
points of interuol evidence.

That the Chatti of Tacitus arethe Suevi of Oaesar, is gronnded
upon the-

o. Absence of the name Clota in the Bellum Gallicum: though
they were the people most immediately in contaot with Gaul.

Evorything in ethnology is a conflict ol difficulties 3 and it
