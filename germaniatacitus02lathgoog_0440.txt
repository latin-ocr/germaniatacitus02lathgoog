Leipsic, were by uo means Saxeus as the people of Sussex
were. They were not even Saxona as the speakers of the
lauguage of the Heliaud‚ the Old Saxeus, were. They were
either Platt·Deutsch, or High-Germau Germans; most pro·
bably a mixture of both. Yet they were called Saxeus,
because they conquered the Sacouy of the nineteeuth century,
from a country which was called Sacouyin the seventh and
eighth, but which, probably, was not so called in tbe fourth
eud fifth, and which, certainly, was not so called in the
second aud third.

7. Procopius mentions only three populations in Britain-
Angles, Frisiaus, aud Britons.

8. Tbe king who ia said to bave determined that England
should be called the Anpleland, was a king of the West·
Saxona, Ecbert.

I consider this a difficulty on oue side fully equivalent to all
ou the other. lt is esis the king of Prussia should propose
that all Germany should call itself Aucta-ia.

I think, upon the whole, that aaron was a word like Greek,
i.e.,a term which, in the language of the Hellenos, was so very
special, partial, and unimportant, as to heve been practically
a foreign term, or, at least, anything but a native name;
whilst in that of the Bernaba it was one of general and
widely-extended impert. Hence, mutatis mutandis, it is the
insignificaut Succusa of the neck of the (limbric Chersonese‚
aud the three Saxon islanda, first mentioued by Ptolemy, who
are the analogues of the equally nnimportant Graeei of Epirus;
and these it was whose name eventually comprised popula-
tions as different as the Angles, aud the Saxone of Saxony,
even as the name &aare iu the mouth of a Roman comprised
Doriens, AEoliaus, Macedonians, Atheniens, Rhodiens, hc.

ln this way the name was German, but its extended im·
port was Kellia aud Roma With this view, there is as
little need to consider tbe Saxona of the neck of the Gimbric
Chersoneso to have been caectly what the Anples were, as there
is for considering the Gracci of Graece to have been exactly
what the Athenianswere. They might easily have belonged
to another sectiou of tbe Gothic population.

Such was, probably, the case. If not, the continuity
