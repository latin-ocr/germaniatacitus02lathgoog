tanea. There wera several limites, or wooden causeways,

through the foreste and marshes, running from the Rhine as
far as the river Lippe, and through westphalia, to the river
Weser. These roads were similar to the one between St.
Petersburg and Novgorod, and Moscow. Varus was led
hythe conspirators to abendon these straight roads, and as
he ventured deeper into the country, the revolt became gene·
ral, aud the Romans found themselves outwitted. Varus
tried ιο retreat and resch the causeway, probably with a
view of defending himselfin the fortress of Aliso on the Lippe.

The question about the exact spot where the battle of
Varus was fought, is one of those which, in my opinion, can
never be satisfactorily answered. The only senabl'e 'and prac-
tical mode of investigating the matter, would beto examine
from what point a Roman road may have been made into
the country of the Germane, and I imagine that Gologne was
a convenient point to start from, but the difficulties were
pretty nearly the same everywhere. It is infinitely more
difficolt to determine anything upon this point, thau to trace
Hannibal's passage over the Alps.

On the first day, Varus was attached on all sides, and at
once lost a great part of his baggage. It was with the
greatest difficulty that he formed a camp for the night, and
fortilied himself. On the following day, he was pressed still
berder, buthe continued his march. The terror and con-
fusion in his columns were so great, that in the evening, when
they were about ιο pitch their camp, the soldiers could
hardly resist the attach. Vama was at last quite overcome
hythe consciousness of his hopeless situation and his respon-
sibihty; and he had several of his officere put an end to their
lives. lt was probably at that moment that Numonius Vala
(apparently the person to whom Horace addressed his epistle)
separated the cavalry from the infantry, and endeavoured, but
unsuccessfully, to escape with his three squadrona alone. They
too were overwhelmed, just as they deserved to be, for
having abandoned their compaciens. On the third day, the
whole of the Roman army was annihilated, only a few escap
ing with their lives. The Germana took awful vengeance
upon their oppressore: many of the Roman prisoners were
