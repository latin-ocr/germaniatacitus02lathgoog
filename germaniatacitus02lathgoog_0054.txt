ἓ XI. ΟΝ caunum leonense Melissus ΟΡ THE GERMAN unstrut
-REAL ΟΒ SUPPOSED·

The connexion of the American with the Englishmnn is

clear. Nearly as clear is tlia't between the Englishman and
the German. ln either case there has been a continuone
extension of the original population3 and that within the
period oi clear and authentis history.

But what if we found Englishmen in countries which no
Englishman was known to have invaded? isolated English·
meni Englishmen cut off from the rest of their nation and
langnagei ln this case we should have a trnly ethnological
sact; since history, pmperly so called, would be silent.

Or what if we found apert from the other Garamas, simi-
larly isolated populations, whose langnage was indeed German,
but osan uncertain affinity-connected with the Dutch as
much as the English, the Norse as much as the Frisian.

What if tho language were lost, and nothing but similarity
of manners, or some vagne tradition connected them with the
assumed parent stockl

The problem would become still more complicated.

Now such problems really exist. There are Goths beyond
the pale of England, Amerina, Germany, and Scandinavia.
They require notice.

1. Tlos Germane ostiis Visentius.- Two (perhaps more)
passages mention the reception‚ on the part of Theodoric the
ostro-Goth, of certain Aleusuuuic Genusus, within tho
boundaries of Italy. One is a letter of his own to Oloris ε-

“Motus vestros in fessas reliquias temperato· quia juro
gratiae merentur evadere, quos od pareutum uestrorum desen
nouem respicitis confugisse. Estote illis remissi, qui uostm
finib ess coluntur emeriti. ”-Cassiod Varierf ιι. 41.

The other rs from the Panegyris of Ennodius:-‘ ‘Quid
quod a te Alamanniae quamcitius intra Italia terminos sine
detrimento Romanae possessionis inclusa esti cui evenit ha·
bere regem, postquam memit perdidisse. Facto est Latiaris
custos imperii semper nostrorum populatione grassata. Oui
