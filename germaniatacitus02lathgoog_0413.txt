tical relations being with the Suevi, Alemanni, Bmguudians,
and the southern Franks. Their ancestors were some of the
Snevi of Tacitus, more especially the Semnones; their de-
scendants the present Sorbs of Saxony and Silerr'o.

The statement of Idatius in chronicon Roncallense is,
that the Vandals of Spain (Audet-usian Spain more particu-
larly) were wandali Silingi. These are admitted by Zenss
to have been the Σίλιογαι of Ptolemy3 as well as ιο hare

This shows that the separation between the two branchee

Alemanni, as blows against the majesty of Rome struck right
and left by the same people.

At any rete, the Germanic leaders of each belonged to one
