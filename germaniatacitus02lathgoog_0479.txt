01 Sallust and (licero, the language points to Gaul as the

intimation 01 itsbeing any particularly 1101001 portion 01 1101

Αο1 1010 an objection may be anticipated. Ι1 10 undoubtedly
true that even if the (limbri had originated ina localityso
distant as the Chersoneso, it would have been almost impos-
sible to have made sucha 1001 accurately understood. Yet it
10 also true, that 11 any material difference had existed between
the Cimbri and the Gauls 01 Gaul, such must have been 10101-
liarly known in Romo, since slaves 01 both sorts must there
have been common.

Now if 110 Teutones and (limbri had moved 11010 00111 10
south, they would have clashed with the Belgae first, and with
the other Gauls afterwards. The converse, however, was the
1001. 11 10 right here to state, that the last observation may
be explained away by supposing either that the Teutones and
Cimbri here meant may bs 0 romanatos 110 confederation on
their return, or else a portion that settled down in Gaul upon
their way; or finally,a division that made a circle towards
the 01000 01 their destination in 0 south-east direction. Nono
01 these, however, seem the plain and natural 0000110010ος
001 I would rather, if reduced to the alternative, read

Diodorus Siculus, without defining their loculity, deals
throughout with the (limbri as a Gaulish tribe. Besides this,
