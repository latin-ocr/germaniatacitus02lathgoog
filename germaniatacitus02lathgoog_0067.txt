In the name Clennci some of the hest writers of Germany
find the root dern=eeoord Hence, the Cherusci are eunde,
and, by extension, acordement.

But there is another nation mentioned by Tacitae, called
tinardones. Saard=ewcrdr and, hence, commeare
οοεο, and nice osred.

Thirdly‚ as scls=dcyyer3 dapper=sword‚ the δοοοοο are
the men of the onds. Hence, emmerammenses&
and the three tribes are the same.

l give this as an illustration of an investigation; valnable.‚
if true. But the trnth is doubtful.

In most investigatione of this sort, two series of facts are
overlooked.

l. The language ιο which the derivational process ie
applied-How many have songht for a Gemma meaning
to the word Germani, without submitting it to the previous
inquiry as ιο whether the name were German at all.

2. The likelihood of the name itself-I will not deny
that natione may be found who give themselves such names
as Sword, Dcpgor, Kaisa, hc. Ι only argue thet the induction
by which auch names can he shown fitting ιο an unknown
case, has yet ιο be made.

A fact that eminently invalidates thie kind of criticism.
is the habit of numerous natione themselves. Many of them
are so fer from snpposing that their name has an intelligible
origin, that they exhibit an nuconscious confession of their
ignorance. The Greeks (for instance) and many Oriental
nations explain their name by supposing that it is that of
the patriarch of their stock-their eponymns. Thus the
· Hellenos derive themselves from Hellen, the Tarte from
Taele, hc. They would not do this if, in the full command
of their own tangue, and in a period comparatively near
the origin of their name, there was some cnstom or attri-
bute connected with themselves which would explain it
better.

I think the etymology of aimpk aocompounded national
names dangerous and nnscientific. In a few cases it is admis-
sible—but only in a few. In the present volume l adopt the

accredited meaning of three simple nncnnpoanded names only
