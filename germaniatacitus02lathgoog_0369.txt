II. If the common Lithnanic character of the Gotbini and
Gothones ba admitted, the Gotba of the Swedish district of
Gottlaod may ba considered.

When two populations of the same name ocenpy the op-
posite sides of a sea of moderata breadth‚ it is reasonable to
suppose they are branches of the same stock.

Such is the case with the Goths of Gothland and the Go-
thones of Gourland.

This primd focio view may, of course, bs set asida by
certam facts.

Certain facts oro against it here. These are-

o. The present Norse character of the Swedes of Gothland.

b. The account of Jornandes.

But (to set against this) the antiquity of tha Swedes of
Gothland is doubtful, and—

The account of J ornandes is improbable.

My own belief is that the populatiou from whom the
Swedish province of Goth-land took the clement (tort, were
no more the Norae ancmtora of its present occupants, than the
people from whom the eounty of Dor-set took the clement
ose, were AnglaSaxon ; anthat, just as tha Dor· in Dor-set
wasa Gellia root (Dur-otriges) though -set was Saron, so was
the Gott— in Goth-land other than Norse though -laacl was
Norae.

a. No Scandiuavian mmo in any of the early writers—tha
chief of these being Jornandes-is more German than such
Auglo·Saxou words as Raab-inp, or Dor-satam names of
which the second parts (dog, aad saeco) are Angla-Saron,
but the first part (Kent, Dor-) Keltic, anot-ii, Dor-otriges.

b. No tradition proves more than the derivation of the aaa
ons from Brut, the grandson of Anchises; in other words,
motatio monada, Jornandes takes the placa of Geoffrey of
Moumouth.

c. No Germania population is found with any formos tha
root Gt, as its name, until it become an inhabitant of some

country so designated. ·
