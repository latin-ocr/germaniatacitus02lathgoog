Undoubtedlye great deal in the way 01 migration and
displaoement may be done in 1110 hundred years, and still
more in seven hundred ς yet it may be safely said that, under
no circumstances whatever, within the historical period, has
any known migration equalled the rapidity and magnitude 01
the one assumed, and that under no circumstances 1100 the
obliteration of all signs of 00 earlier population been eo
complete.

Horo could the displaoement inferred from this 01101 obliter-
ation, have taken placet Was it by a process of ejectiou, so
that the presumed immigrant 8100001000 conquered and ex·
pelled the original Gotho? The chauces of war, when we get
to the historical period, run the other way; aud the first
1001 which 110 know concerning those sslf-same Slavonians,
who 010 supposed to have dispossessed the Germane in the
third and fourth centurias, is that, in the ninth, the Germana
disposscssed them. But, perhaps, the Germans were more

ask if it may not be the case, that, 111100 those Germane, who
are admitted to have 1011 their country in great numbers,
migrated southwards, they left 1001 gaps iu the population 01
their original areas, which the Slavonians from behind filled
up, even by the force 01 pressure; since geography abhors a

1 11111 001 say that this view is wholly unsupported by in·
duction. Something of the kind may be found amongst the
Indiaue of North Ameriae, where a hunting·ground abandoned
by 000 tribe is appropriated by another. The magnitude,
however, of such vacuities is trifling compared with theone
